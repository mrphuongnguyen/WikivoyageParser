The <a href="/wiki/Great_Plains" title="Great Plains">Great Plains</a> are dry, flat and grassy, turning into arid <b>desert</b> in the far West and <b>Mediterranean</b> along the California coast.</p><p>In the winter, the northern and mid-western major cities can see as much as 2 feet (61&nbsp;cm) of snowfall in one day, with cold temperatures. Summers are humid, but mild. Temperatures over 100&nbsp;°F (38&nbsp;°C) sometimes invade the Midwest and Great Plains.

Average annual precipitation is low, usually less than 10 inches (25&nbsp;cm).</p><p>Cool and damp weather is common much of the year in the coastal northwest (Oregon and Washington west of the Cascade Range, and the northern part of California west of the Coast Ranges/Cascades). Summers (July through September) are usually quite dry with low humidity, though, making it the ideal climate for outdoor activities. Rain is most frequent in winter, snow is rare, especially along the coast, and extreme temperatures are uncommon. Rain falls almost exclusively from late fall through early spring along the coast. East of the Cascades, the northwest is considerably drier. Much of the inland northwest is either semi-arid or desert, especially in Oregon.</p><p>Northeastern and Upper Southern cities are known for summers with temperatures reaching into the 90s (32&nbsp;°C) or more, with extremely high humidity, usually over 80%. This can be a drastic change from the Southwest. High humidity means that the temperature can feel hotter than actual readings. The Northeast also experiences snow, and at least once every few years there will be a dumping of the white stuff in enormous quantities.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: History">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p><b>Native Americans</b>, or <b>American Indians</b>, arrived 13,500 to 16,000 years ago from migrating northeast Asian peoples. Old stereotypes of their primitiveness misrepresent the wide variety of sophisticated societies that existed before the first arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century. For example, the Mississippian cultures built huge mounds and large towns that covered the Southeast, and the Anasazi built elaborate cliff-side towns in the Southwest. These societies were decimated by Old-World diseases such as smallpox and pushed west by warfare and encroaching European settlers; their diminished numbers led to further marginalization, although today their cultures continue to endure and contribute to the American experience.</p><p><b>European colonization</b> began in the 16th and 17th centuries. <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>, and <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> gained large holdings; the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> also established outposts.

Independence Hall in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> was where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were drafted</div>
</div>
</div><p>By the early 18th century, Great Britain had colonized the Atlantic coast from <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(state)" title="Georgia (state)">Georgia</a> north into what is now Canada. Britain's dominance in North America was established in 1763 after the global Seven Years' War. In part to finance the North American campaigns of the war, known as the French and Indian War, Britain imposed unpopular taxes and regulations on its colonists. This precipitated revolution in 1775 and on 4 July 1776, colonists from 13 colonies declared full independence. The <b>Revolutionary War</b> lasted until 1783, when the new United States of America formally took control of all British land between the Atlantic and the Mississippi River.</p><p>Wrangling over the formation of a national government lasted until 1787 when a constitution was agreed upon. Its Enlightenment-era ideas about individual liberty have since inspired the founding decrees of many states. <b>George Washington</b>, the General in chief of the revolutionary army, was elected the first president. By the turn of the 19th century, the newly-built <b><a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a></b> was established as the national capital.</p><p>New states were created as white settlers moved west beyond the Appalachian Mountains. The Native American populations were duly displaced and further harrowed by war and disease. The 1803 <b>Louisiana Purchase</b> of French lands to the west of the Mississippi effectively doubled the country's area, and provided "Indian Territory" in what is now Oklahoma for the many Native American tribes from the east that were forcibly relocated during the Trail of Tears of the 1830s.</p><p>Disagreements with British commerce policies arising from the Napoleonic Wars and Royal Navy impressment led to the <b>War of 1812</b>. There were over two years of dramatic action on land and sea that included an attempted invasion of Canada and the burning of the White House, Capitol, and other public buildings in Washington, DC. The final stalemate saw virtually no changes of territory, but the war galvanized separate American and Canadian identities. The national anthem, <b>"The Star-Spangled Banner"</b>, was conceived during the war. Western Native American tribes that had sided with the British suffered greatly as their territory was given to white settlers.</p><p>After the war, industry and infrastructure were expanded greatly, particularly in the Northeast. Roads and canals came first and helped people spread inland. In 1825, the <a href="/wiki/Erie_Canal" title="Erie Canal">Erie Canal</a> connected the Atlantic to the Great Lakes. By the 1860s, railroads and telegraph lines connected the east and west coasts via the industrial hub of <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Midwest_(United_States_of_America)" title="Midwest (United States of America)">Midwest</a>. In the early 19th century, a series of religious revivals, the Second Great Awakening, led to various reform movements that strove for goals such as temperance, the abolition of slavery, and women's suffrage.</p><div class="thumb tright">

The 1836 Battle of the Alamo (<a href="/wiki/San_Antonio" title="San Antonio">San Antonio</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>) was a crucial moment of the Texas Revolution.</div>
</div>
</div><p>U.S. expansion south and west chipped away at Spanish and Mexican territory. Spain sold <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> in 1813 after American military intervention; and an 1836 rebellion by American settlers in Mexican Texas founded an independent republic which was absorbed into the Union ten years later. This sparked the <b>Mexican–American War</b> in which Mexico lost what is now <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>, and <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and the continental United States essentially assumed its modern outline. Native Americans were relegated to reservations and continued to be purged by treaty, military force, and disease from settlers on the Oregon Trail and other westward routes.</p><p>Federal governance was light and the individual states were highly autonomous. By the 1850s, there was irreconcilable disparity between the industrialized and more urban Northern states, which had all outlawed slavery within three decades of the revolution, and the plantation-dependent rural South. The North wanted to impose a national ban on the expansion of slavery, while the Southern states sought to expand slavery into new territories. Abolitionists operated an <a href="/wiki/Underground_Railroad" title="Underground Railroad">Underground Railroad</a> leading fugitive slaves in the northern states to freedom in <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>. In 1861, eleven Southern states, fearful of marginalization and the avowedly anti-slavery <b>President Abraham Lincoln</b>, broke from the Union and formed an independent Confederate States of America. The ensuing <b>American Civil War</b> remains the bloodiest conflict on American soil and killed hundreds of thousands. In 1865, Union forces prevailed, firmly cementing the federal government's authority over the states. Slavery was abolished nationwide and the Confederate states were re-admitted into the Union during a period of Reconstruction. The former slaves and their descendants were to remain an economic and social underclass, particularly in the South.</p><p>Russia sold its tenuously held Alaskan territory in 1867, and the previously independent Hawaii was annexed in 1898. The United States' decisive victory over Spain in the 1898 <b>Spanish–American War</b> gained it colonial territories: <a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> (granted independence a few years later), the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> (granted independence shortly after World War II), <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Guam" title="Guam">Guam</a> (which remain American dependencies).</p><p>In the late 19th and into the 20th century, Southern and Eastern Europeans, Russian Jews, and Irish refugees bolstered the continuing industrialization of the eastern cities by providing cheap labor. Many Southern African-Americans fled rural poverty for industrial jobs in the North. Other immigrants, including many Scandinavians and Germans, moved to newly opened territories in the West and Midwest, where land was given to anyone who would develop it.</p><p>The United States' entrance into <b>World War I</b> in 1917 marked the start of an era it would ultimately dominate politically. However, soon after the victory the U.S. eschewed international involvement and refused to join the nascent League of Nations, effectively crippling the organization. Real wealth grew rapidly and the Roaring 20s saw stock speculation that created an immense "bubble" which burst in 1929, leading to the global economic havoc of the <b>Great Depression</b>. The resulting privation fostered a culture of sacrifice and hard work that would serve the country well in the coming conflict. It also ushered in Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his "New Deal", a series of government programs that constructed thousands of buildings and bridges across the country while creating the basis of the American welfare state.</p><div class="thumb tright">

</div>
</div><p>In 1941 Japan attacked <b>Pearl Harbor</b>, a Hawaiian naval base, plunging the United States into <b>World War II</b> alongside British, Soviet, and Chinese allies. The U.S. developed atomic bombs and dropped them twice on Japan in 1945, abruptly ending the war. By the end of the war, the United States had firmly established itself as the world's dominant economic power, responsible for nearly half of global industrial production. The subsequent nuclear-armed <b>Cold War</b> saw the United States and the Soviet Union jostle for power while courting their own mutually assured destruction.</p><p>For the century after the Civil War, blacks, though ostensibly equal citizens under the post-Civil War amendments to the U.S. Constitution, suffered through strong social and economic, political, and social discrimination and state-sanctioned segregation, especially in the South. A movement fighting for full civil rights for black Americans gained strength following World War II, when returning black veterans who fought against racism abroad came home to find they were still being denied service at lunch counters, hotels, and many other establishments and facing discrimination in employment and housing. The <b>civil rights movement</b> vehemently, but largely peacefully, vied for equal rights. With <b>Martin Luther King, Jr.</b>, a charismatic preacher, as its most visible leader, the movement came to a head in 1963 when 200,000–300,000 people flooded the capital to listen to him. A revived women's movement in the 1960s also led to wide-ranging changes in American society.</p><p>Postwar America was characterized by affluence and industrialization. People left agriculture and moved to the cities to become part of an increasingly technology-based economy. American car culture emerged in the 1950s and was supported by the construction of a comprehensive Interstate Highway System. The American consumer culture, as well as Hollywood movies and many forms of popular music, arguably established the United States as the cultural center of the world. The U.S. has also grown into one of the world's major centers of higher education, being home to some of the world's most prestigious universities, and attracting more international students than any other country in the world.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Government_and_politics">Government and politics</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Government and politics">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>The United States is a federal republic. Its major constituents are the 50 states and the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.); it also has various island territories in the Caribbean and Pacific that are strongly&nbsp;– but often not fully&nbsp;– integrated into the union. Many of these territories are within the U.S. customs and immigration area and so for practical purposes can be considered part of the U.S. (See <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America#Travel_to_U.S._possessions" title="United States of America">Travel to U.S. possessions</a>).</p><p>The federal government derives its power from the Constitution, which is the oldest written constitution in continuous use. Within the overarching federal laws, each state maintains its own constitution, government and laws, and so retains considerable autonomy within the federation. State laws can vary in their details but are, for the most part, fairly uniform from state to state.</p><p>The President is elected every four years and is the head of the federal government as well as head of state. His administration forms the executive branch. The bicameral Congress (comprising the lower House of Representatives and the upper Senate) constitutes the legislative branch. The Supreme Court tops the judicial branch. State governments are organized similarly, with governors, legislatures, and judiciaries.</p><p>Two major political parties have dominated at both state and federal levels since the end of the Civil War: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. While smaller political parties exist, the winner-take-all electoral system means that they rarely succeed at any level.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Culture">Culture</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Culture">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class="thumb tright">

</div><p>The United States is made up of many diverse ethnic groups and the culture varies greatly across the vast area of the country and even within cities&nbsp;– a city like New York will have dozens, if not hundreds, of different ethnicities represented within a neighborhood. Despite this difference, there exists a strong sense of national identity and certain predominant cultural traits. Generally, Americans tend to believe strongly in personal responsibility and that an individual determines his or her own success or failure, but there are many exceptions and that a nation as diverse as the United States has literally thousands of distinct cultural traditions. One will find Mississippi in the South to be very different culturally from Massachusetts in the North.</p><p>Religion is very important in the United States. Only 20% of people in the United States identify with no religion, which is very low in comparison to other Western nations. Roughly one-quarter of Americans are Roman Catholic, and one-half of them are Protestant, with Protestantism being further broken down into mainline, Evangelical and Pentecostal sects. There are much smaller numbers of Jews, Mormons, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and a host of other religions. Because of many Americans' strong religious belief, many businesses and institutions are closed on Sundays, and a number of areas in the South and Midwest forbid certain actions from taking place on Sunday, while some Jewish businesses close on Friday nights and Saturdays for the sabbath.</p><p>Overall, while the United States is less religious than many other nations, it is more religious than <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="/wiki/Northern_Europe" title="Northern Europe" class="mw-redirect">Northern Europe</a>; however, this trend varies greatly by region, with the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" title="Pacific Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> being largely secular and the <a href="/wiki/South_(United_States_of_America)" title="South (United States of America)">American South</a> being extraordinarily Christian, particularly Evangelical. Differences in religiosity largely correlate with politics, too, so the Northeast and West Coast are generally liberal and Democratic; most of the South and heavily Mormon states like Utah, Idaho and Wyoming are very conservative and Republican; and much of the rest of the country (e.g., several Midwestern, Southwestern/Rocky Mountain, and Southern coastal states) is nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holidays">Holidays</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Holidays">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>There are no nationwide, mandatory public holidays. Federal holidays are the most centrally coordinated holidays, but they are only officially recognized by the federal government; federal offices, banks, and post offices close on these days. Nearly all states and localities also observe these holidays, as well as a handful of their own. If a federal holiday falls on a weekend, the observance will normally be shifted to the <b>nearest weekday</b>.</p><p>The time between Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November) and January 1 has such a high concentration of major holidays that it is often simply called "the holiday season." School and work vacations are commonly taken during this period, with people visiting family and friends. Airports, bus stations, and train stations will be very crowded near the major holidays. If you must travel, allow extra time to check in and clear security. This is also a major gift giving season; most shopping malls and department stores will be crowded, especially on the day after Thanksgiving, the week before Christmas, and the day after Christmas.</p><p>In the list below, federal holidays are listed in <i><b>bold italics</b></i>.</p><ul>
<li><i><b>New Year's Day</b></i> (1 January)&nbsp;— most non-retail businesses closed; parades; brunches and football parties.</li>
<li><i><b>Martin Luther King Day</b></i> (third Monday in January)&nbsp;— many government offices and banks closed; people volunteer in their communities; speeches, especially on African-American history and culture.</li>
<li><b>Chinese New Year</b> (January/February&nbsp;— varies based on the Chinese lunar calendar)&nbsp;— Chinese cultural celebration.</li>
<li><b>Super Bowl Sunday</b> (usu. first Sunday in February)&nbsp;— The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the NFL American football league and the most-watched sporting event of the year; supermarkets, bars, and electronics stores busy; big football-watching parties.</li>
<li><b>Lincoln's Birthday</b> (second Monday in February) - Holiday in several states; many stores have sales.</li>
<li><b>(St.) Valentine's Day</b> (14 February)&nbsp;— private celebration of romance and love. Most restaurants are crowded; finer restaurants may require reservations made well in advance.</li>
<li><i><b>Presidents Day</b></i> (third Monday in February; officially <b>Washington's Birthday</b>)&nbsp;— many government offices and banks closed; many stores have sales.</li>
<li><b>St. Patrick's Day</b> (17 March)&nbsp;— Irish-themed parades and parties. Expect bars to be crowded. They will often feature themed drink specials. The wearing of green clothes or accessories is common.</li>
<li><b>Easter</b> (a Sunday in March or April)&nbsp;— Christian religious observances. Depending on location, many restaurants, including franchised outlets of major national chains, may close. Major retailers generally open; smaller shops may or may not close.</li>
<li><b>Passover</b> (varies based on the Jewish calendar, eight days around Easter)&nbsp;— Jewish religious observances.</li>
<li><b>Cinco de Mayo</b> (5 May)&nbsp;— A minor holiday in most of Mexico often incorrectly assumed to be Mexican Independence Day, but nevertheless a major cultural celebration for Mexican-Americans. As with St. Patrick's Day, expect bars to be crowded, frequently with themed drink specials.</li>
<li><b>Mother's Day</b> (second Sunday in May)&nbsp;— Children and adults give gifts to their mothers. Most restaurants are crowded; finer restaurants may require reservations made well in advance.</li>
<li><i><b>Memorial Day</b></i> (last Monday in May)&nbsp;— most non-retail businesses closed; some patriotic observances; trips to beaches and parks; <i>traditional beginning of summer tourism season</i>.</li>

<li><b>Halloween</b> (31 October)&nbsp;— Children dress up in costume and go trick-or-treating (knocking on other houses' doors to get candy and other treats). There are spooky attractions, such as haunted corn mazes, hayrides and costume parties. Some small family-owned shops and restaurants may close early in the evening.</li>
<li><i><b>Veterans Day</b></i> (11 November)&nbsp;— government offices and banks closed; some patriotic observances.</li>
<li><i><b>Thanksgiving Day</b></i> (fourth Thursday in November)&nbsp;— Family dinners; many people fly or drive to visit extended family.

<dd><i>See also: <a href="/wiki/Metric_and_Imperial_equivalents" title="Metric and Imperial equivalents">Metric and Imperial equivalents</a></i></dd>
</dl><p>The United States is the only industrialized country that eschews the metric system. Instead it uses "customary units" (feet, miles, gallons, pounds, etc.), which are largely derived from the English units of the 18th century, and are sometimes different from the imperial units that occasionally linger in Britain. Road distances are given in miles and speed limits in miles per hour. Gasoline and other liquids are usually sold per gallon, quart, or ounce (a U.S. gallon is 3.78 liters, so a U.S. quart [a <i>quart</i>er gallon] is slightly less than a liter). Beverages such as soda are sometimes sold by the liter and other times sold by the fluid ounce, with just under 34 ounces to a liter. Temperatures are reported in Fahrenheit only; 32 degrees (with units unspecified) is freezing, not warm! Most cars' speedometers show both miles and kilometers per hour (good for trips to Canada and Mexico), and almost all packaged foods and other products are labeled in both systems. Outside of scientific work, medicine and the military, there is little day-to-day exposure to the metric system, so Americans will assume you understand the U.S. customary measures.</p><p>There is no government regulation of clothes or shoe sizes. There are ill-enforced informal standards, and the only thing you can count on is that sizes tend to be consistent within the same brand. Therefore, trial and error is required for <i>each brand</i> to determine what fits, because you cannot count on any two brands' sizes being equivalent.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Visitor_information">Visitor information</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Visitor information">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>The federal government of the U.S. sets foreign policy, while the states deal with tourism. As such, the federal government provides the best information about legal requirements for entry, while information about places to visit and see will be provided by the state and local tourism bureaus. Contact information is available in the individual state entries. Highway rest stops at state borders, as well as major airports in a state, usually serve as Visitor's Centers and often offer travel and tourism information and material, almost all of which is also available online. Nearly every rest stop has a posted road map with a clearly indicated "You Are Here" marker. Some also offer free paper roadmaps to take with you. If you call or write the state Commerce department, they can also mail you information.</p></div>

Travelers with such obsolete passports will either need to replace them, or apply for a visa.</p><p>Entry under the Visa Waiver Program by air or sea requires travel with a signatory carrier. Any commercial scheduled services to the U.S. will be fine, but if you are on a chartered flight or vessel you should check the status of the carrier, as you may require a visa. Flying your own personal aircraft, or sailing your own personal yacht to the U.S. will require you to obtain a tourist visa in advance.</p><p>Travelers entering by air or sea should also have a return or onward ticket out of the United States.

</tbody></table><p>For the rest of the world, the visa application fee is a non-refundable <b>$160</b> (as of April 2012) for visas that are not issued on the basis of a petition and $190 for those that are; this fee is waived under very limited circumstances, namely for people requesting certain exchange visitor visas.</p><p>Depending on your nationality and the category of visa you are requesting, you may need to pay an additional fee (ranging from $7–200) only if the visa is issued. This is called a reciprocity fee and is charged by the U.S. to match the fees charged by other countries on U.S. citizens.</p><p>The Immigration and Nationality Act states that all persons requesting entry into the United States as non-immigrants are presumed to be immigrants until they overcome that presumption by showing evidence of "binding ties" to their home country as well as sufficient proof that the visit will be temporary. When the U.S. rejects a visa application, it is usually because the applicant does not have enough binding ties to his own country to convince the consular officer that the person will not try to overstay. Applicants need to demonstrate that they are indeed genuinely entitled to the visa they are applying for. Face-to-face interviews (where the official needs to be convinced that you are not a "potential immigrant") at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate are required for almost all nationalities, and waits for interview slots and visa processing can add up to several months.</p><p>Keep in mind that the embassy is closed on both U.S. holidays and holidays of your home country so you need to know both holidays when setting dates to apply for a visa. In addition, travelers should start planning their trips way in advance, as the application process is known to take up to six months.</p><p><i>Do not assume anything</i>. Check on documentation requirements with the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://travel.state.gov/">United States State Department</a> or with the United States consulate nearest you. If coming to the country with a car, be sure to have documents showing car insurance, rental agreements, driver's license, etc., before trying to enter the U.S. If your country participates in the Visa Waiver Program, note that having been denied a visa for whatever reason, including a lack of relevant documentation will result in you being ineligible for the program and having to obtain a visa for every subsequent visit to the US.</p><p>For <b>technical and scientific fields</b> of work or study, processing non-immigrant visa application can take up to 70 days, as it can require 8 weeks for receiving an approval from authorities in Washington. This especially applies to military and dual-purpose fields which are mentioned in a so-called <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.bu.edu/isso/forms/tal.pdf">technical alert list</a>.</p><p>A visa is not a guarantee of entry; it only allows you to proceed to a port of entry and request admission. Your visa is generally not tied to your permitted length of stay; for example, a 10-year visa does not allow a stay of 10 years. On the other hand, you can enter the country on the last day of validity of your visa and still be allowed to stay, for example, up to 180 days as a tourist.</p><p>Applying for an incorrect or inappropriate visa can cause serious problems, including possibly making you ineligible to ever receive any U.S. visa (especially in cases of fraud). Consider consulting a U.S. immigration attorney, especially if you want to stay longer or do something other than business or tourism. This includes performing in concerts or competitions as well as journalism.</p><div class="thumb tright">

Be prepared to prove your stated motives for entering. Proof of onward travel may be required. For business, this can be an invitation letter from a company you are visiting, or the registration details of a conference you are attending. For tourists, you may need to demonstrate you have funds available to you.</p><p>If you don't fully comply with all that's required, e.g. no onward transport, you may be sent for further questioning. At this stage your possessions may be searched and your documents, letters or diaries may be read. If you are found to appear as a likely immigrant (e.g. if you're carrying employment documents, photographs typically kept at home, excessive luggage, or pets) or if you are unable to convince the officers that you intend to abide by the terms of your stated entrance permission, you will be refused entry and deported. If your country participates in the Visa-Waiver Program, note that being refused entry will result in you being ineligible for the program and having to obtain a visa for every subsequent visit to the US.</p><p>Once they decide to let you in, you are <b>fingerprinted</b> and a <b>digital photograph</b> is taken.</p><p>As in most countries, customs officials are humorless about any kind of security threat; even the most flippant joke implying that you pose a threat can result in lengthy interrogation, at best.</p><p>The landing card will need to state the <b>address</b> of your first night's accommodation, which should be arranged in advance. The name of your hotel, hostel, university, etc. is not sufficient; the street name and number are needed. If it is a hotel, have a reservation under your name. If it is a private address, make sure that you are expected, as officials may phone your host to see if they're expecting anyone. Try to have contact details (especially a phone number where they can be reached immediately), and save any text messages or emails in which your hosts mention inviting you to stay at their residence.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Customs">Customs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21" title="Edit section: Customs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>A customs form is handed out to all travelers; however, only one form is required per family. Hand your customs declaration to the customs officer, not immigration. Regardless of whether you have anything to declare, customs officers may still search or X-ray your bags. Most of the time, they won't. Anything more than a bag search is rare, so you won't likely encounter any ominous latex gloves.</p><p>You can't bring meat or raw fruit or vegetables but you may bring cooked non-meats, such as bread (however you <b>must declare <u>all</u> food items brought into the United States</b> even if they're unrestricted). It is also generally prohibited to bring in goods made in countries on which the U.S. has imposed economic sanctions: Cuba, <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_Korea" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> (DPRK), <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Myanmar" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> (Burma).</p><p>Besides your personal effects, which will go home with you, you are allowed to import $200 of merchandise duty-free, including 1 liter of alcohol (for those 21 and older only) and 1 carton of cigarettes. There is no restriction on the amount of money you can bring in or out of the US. However, if you are bringing in or out $10,000 or more (or its equivalent in foreign currency) per family (combined total among all family members travelling together), you must declare it on your customs form and you will be given a special form to fill out; not declaring exposes you to a fine and possible seizure of that cash.</p><p>The U.S. possessions of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands are outside the federal customs jurisdiction and each have their own separate requirements. Travel between these regions and the rest of the U.S. requires a customs check.

Since you have had access to your checked bags while going through customs, you will need to re-clear security before taking a connecting flight. Nearly all major hubs have special arrangements for travelers with connecting flights, such as a conveyor belt just beyond customs where you can place your baggage that has been already been tagged for transfer your final destination. Some hubs, like JFK, employ a more inconvenient system, whereby you must show your ID and boarding pass at a "Connecting Flights" check-in counter. At airports with separate domestic and international terminals (such as <a href="/wiki/Boston" title="Boston">Boston</a>), you will have to head to another terminal and drop your bags there before heading to security.</p><p>These bag drop procedures apply only if your baggage has been checked through to your final destination (as opposed to your first U.S. port of entry).

</div><p>Unlike most countries, the U.S. has no formal passport control upon exit, especially for those traveling by air or sea. As such, if you are leaving the U.S. for the last time on a particular trip (i.e. not returning from Canada or Mexico), it is your responsibility to surrender your landing card at check-in, or the Canadian or Mexican border officer. If you don't, contact U.S. officials about how to return it and update your departure records to avoid any future entry hassles. If you leave by a commercial carrier, your departure will also be verified with the airline or shipping company. Hence no further action should be needed from you; nonetheless on future visits consider bringing the necessary documents to prove you left legally. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://help.cbp.gov/cgi-bin/customs.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=752">information</a> about what to do if your slip is not collected.</p><p>If you intend to leave for Canada or Mexico by land for a side trip and return within 30 days or the allowed time of your stay (whichever is shorter), you may re-enter the U.S. provided that you do <b>not yet</b> return the I-94 or I-94 card before you proceed to Canada or Mexico. This can also be done even if you originally entered the U.S. on a single-entry visa. However, you will only be admitted for the remainder of your original allowed time; the deadline to ultimately leave the U.S. won't be extended by just leaving for somewhere else in North America. If you return the I-94 while on the side trip, you will have to apply all over again to enter the U.S. (which means a new visa for single-entry visa holders) and be subject to the usual questioning that alien go through to lack of any intentions of immigrating, working, or doing something else not authorized by the visa.</p><p>That said, try to avoid re-entering the U.S. a few days, weeks or months after one visit. Even if you don't technically overstay, planning several U.S. visits spaced shortly after each other may be interpreted by immigration officers as "immigrant intent" and may cause you grief.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_plane">By plane</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24" title="Edit section: By plane">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class="thumb tright">

</div><p>The United States is home to some of the most popular airlines in the world. Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and resultant fall in air traffic, the entire industry has seen consolidation on a grand scale and the US is now home to some of the largest airlines in the world. Most visitors from outside Canada and Mexico arrive in the United States by plane. While many medium sized inland cities have an international airport, there are limited flights to most of these and most travelers find themselves entering the U.S. at one of the major entry points along the coasts. The international airports in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> and <a href="/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a> are the four main points of entry to the United States by plane.</p><ul>

Of course, if you arrive in Honolulu, you must take another flight to get to the mainland. Foreign airlines are <i>not</i> allowed to transport passengers to/from Hawaii or Alaska and the other 48 states (except for refueling and in-transit). If you are flying into the West Coast to transit to another destination, San Francisco airport has a free frequent skytrain linking terminals and short security queues, compared to Los Angeles which will see you exposed to the elements catching a shuttle bus or walking between terminals. Chicago, while not on the west coast, is still a major point of entry from Asia, offering non-stop flights from <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Seoul" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>, with direct service from Bangkok and Singapore.

Allow at least three hours at your first U.S. stop.</p><p>Luggage allowance for flights to or from the U.S. usually operates on a piecewise system in addition to the weight system even for foreign carriers. This means that you are allowed a limited number of bags to check-in where <b>each</b> bag should not exceed certain linear dimensions (computed by adding the length, width and height of the bags). The exact allowances and restrictions on weight, linear dimension and number of baggage allowed are determined by the carrier you are flying with, your origin (if coming to the U.S.) or destination (if leaving) and the class of service you are traveling in.</p><p>When arriving once you have collected your luggage you can head toward the exit. Most airports have near the exit a wall of "courtesy phones" with the description and the prices of motels in the area. You can call these motels free of charge and ask for a room and a pick up shuttle will come to fetch you at the airport. It is very convenient and mostly free of charge (but you are supposed to tip the driver).</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Airport_security">Airport security</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25" title="Edit section: Airport security">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><div class="thumb tright">

</div><p>Security procedures for commercial flights departing from anywhere in the U.S. continue to evolve. The <b>TSA</b> (Transportation Security Administration) now requires all passengers to remove shoes and outerwear and submit personal belongings to X-ray screening. Random passengers may now be selected for additional screening. This may include an "enhanced pat-down," or you may be required to submit to a full-body X-ray. Do not assume that you are in any sort of trouble or that you are even suspected of causing trouble, simply because you are being subjected to these screenings.</p><p>If you wish to lock your checked baggage, the TSA requires you to use special locks that have the Travel Sentry TSA lock system.

As far as most flights from Canada are concerned, they are treated similarly as U.S. domestic flights but only because clearance has been performed at the Canadian airport. Hence once passengers from Canada arrive at their U.S. port of entry, rather than walk through a secluded corridor, they can see the display of restaurants and shops at the domestic terminal on their way to baggage claim. It is worth noting that most Canadian carriers are located in U.S. domestic terminals.</p><p>Travelers on U.S.–Canadian flights operated by foreign carriers like Philippine Airlines and Cathay Pacific will still encounter traditional entry formalities upon arrival at their first U.S. stop; a Canadian transit visa may be required even if passengers are confined to a holding area for the entire transit time.</p><p>Some airports in Canada, including <a href="/wiki/Vancouver" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> International Airport, Terminal 1 of <a href="/wiki/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>-Pearson Airport, and <a href="/wiki/Montr%C3%A9al" title="Montréal" class="mw-redirect">Montréal</a>-Trudeau Airport generally do not require passengers in transit from abroad to pass through Canadian Customs and Immigration controls before going through U.S. preclearance formalities.

</div><p>The size of the U.S. and the distance separating major cities make air the dominant mode of travel for short-term travelers. If you have time, travel by car, bus, or <a href="/wiki/Amtrak" title="Amtrak" class="mw-redirect">rail</a> can be interesting.</p><p>Some states offer traffic and public transport information by dialing 511 on your phone.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_plane_2">By plane</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=33" title="Edit section: By plane">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>The quickest and often the most convenient way of long-distance intercity travel in the U.S. is by plane. Coast-to-coast travel takes about six hours from east to west, and 5 hours from west to east (varying due to winds), compared to the days necessary for land transportation. Most large cities in the U.S. are served by one or two airports; many smaller towns also have some passenger air service, although you may need to detour through a major hub airport to get there. Depending on where you are starting, it may be cheaper to drive to a nearby large city and fly or, conversely, to fly to a large city near your destination and rent a car.</p><p>Major carriers compete for business on major routes, and travelers willing to book two or more weeks in advance can get bargains. However most smaller destinations are served by only one or two regional carriers, and prices there can be expensive.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Service_types">Service types</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34" title="Edit section: Service types">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>There are several types of airlines flying in the United States today:</p><ul>
<li><b>Mainline</b> or <b>legacy carriers</b>&nbsp;– Due to bankruptcies and mergers, there are only four major and two minor legacy carriers left: Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines, and US Airways, plus Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines. These carriers used to be full service, although are increasingly taking after carriers like Ryanair and becoming "no-frills". On a domestic flight in economy class, expect to pay extra for anything beyond a seat, one or two carry-on bags, and soft drinks. Some flights to/from Hawaii or Alaska still offer a few perks, but check for your particular airline and flight.
<dl>
<dd>Mainline carriers also offer <b>first class</b> for a larger seat, free food and drinks and overall better service. Round trip fares can run over a thousand dollars, even for short flights, making the added cost not worth it for the vast majority of travelers. (Most travelers in first class get their seat as a free frequent flier upgrade or similar perk.) You may also be offered an upgrade at a much lower cost during check in or at the airport if there are open seats available.</dd>
<dd>A notable exception are certain premium transcontinental services between New York City and Los Angeles/San Francisco offered by American ("<i>Flagship Service</i>") and United ("<i>United p.s.</i>"), where First (as well as Business Class) is comparable to equivalent international offerings with gourmet meals and lie-flat seats. Additionally, flights between the East Coast and Hawaii typically feature an international business class like product.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Regional airlines</b> come in three varieties:
<ul>
<li><b>Regional subsidiaries</b> operate under an umbrella such as "American Eagle" or "United Express" and run small regional jets or turboprops to locales where it is not economically or technically feasible to run a full sized jet. These flights are booked through their parent (e.g. Delta Connection through Delta), either by themselves or connecting to a mainline itinerary. On-board service is very basic.</li>
<li>There are also <b>Independent regional airlines</b> which are not affiliated with a mainline carrier, these are usually found in more out of the way places, as well as near island communities (Cape Cod, Hawaii, Virgin Islands, etc...)</li>
<li><b>Commuter airlines</b> primarily serve the business travel market, with 10–30 seat turboprop planes. If you can work with their schedules and choice of airports (usually private aviation airports and municipal airfields)&nbsp;– their consistent fares can be a bargain compared even to low cost carriers. Additionally, since fares are the same whether you buy a month in advance or the day of, tickets are also flexible with no cancellation or change fees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><dl>
<dd>More than a hundred small towns, each seventy miles or more from a major hub, receive an <b>Essential Air Service</b> federal subsidy for two scheduled flights daily to any one major city. Intended to prevent cities from losing service to deregulation, these regional flights typically run with small aircraft which seat 9 to 35 passengers.</dd>
</dl><ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Low-cost_airlines_in_North_America" title="Low-cost airlines in North America">Low-cost carriers</a></b> have grown over the past decade. The most famous of these is ubiquitous <b>Southwest Airlines</b>, favorite of leisure and business travelers alike, with <b>Frontier</b>, <b>Spirit</b>, and others becoming formidable competitors. Amenities vary greatly by carrier. On one end, Southwest is the only airline in the United States that lets passengers check two bags free of charge, and have done away with some of the formality of air travel&nbsp;– with no travel agents (all reservations are through their website or call center), assigned seating or buy-on-board programs (free soft drinks and snacks for all passengers.) At the other side of the Spectrum, Spirit Airlines sells seats as low as $9, but charges for everything beyond the seat: checked <u>and</u> hand luggage, advance seat assignments, checking in at the airport, on board refreshments, etc....
<ul>
<li>Southwest, Frontier and Spirit serve destinations nationwide, although they sometimes use smaller or alternative airports such as Chicago Midway instead of the larger O'Hare International Airport.</li>
<li>Other low-cost carriers such as Allegiant and Sun Country focus on "vacation destinations" (Florida, Mexico, the Virgin Islands, etc...)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Hybrid carriers</b> offer more amenities than low cost airlines but with fares lower than the legacies. The most famous of these is <b>JetBlue Airways</b> which has an extensive network covering primarily major airports, one free checked bag, 34 inches between seats (very generous for an American airline) and free satellite TV in every seat. A relative newcomer is the trendy brainchild of Sir Richard Branson: <b>Virgin America</b> which also offers a low-priced (comparatively anyway) First Class option.</li>
</ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fees">Fees</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=35" title="Edit section: Fees">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>Quoted prices, both from airlines themselves and from consolidators, generally include all taxes and other mandatory fees, and there is no fuel surcharge. However, extra services tend to incur extra fees. The main ones are listed here, along with strategies for avoiding them. Even baggage fees can be avoided with careful planning:</p><ul>
<li><b>Checking in with an agent</b>&nbsp;— Some airlines charge $3–10 to check in with an actual human being. Spirit Airlines also charges for using a kiosk at the airport kiosk rather than checking in online. Unless you need to check in with an agent (e.g., if you have specialized equipment that qualifies for a baggage fee waiver), you should check in online and print your own boarding pass. This also saves time at the airport. Some airlines accept emailed boarding passes displayed on smart phones, obviating the need to print them, although many smaller and regional airports do not support mobile boarding passes yet.</li>
<li><b>Checked baggage</b>&nbsp;— Expect to pay $25–35 to check a single bag, an additional $50 for a second bag, and up to $100 or more for a third bag. Particularly large or heavy bags can easily double or triple these fees. Shop around, as some discount carriers give a free baggage allowance; e.g. JetBlue (one bag) and Southwest (two bags).
<ul>
<li>Each passenger's cost-free cabin baggage allowance is generally one small suitcase or garment bag and one item such as a briefcase, backpack, or purse. If you can get all your belongings into your cabin baggage, this is the best way to avoid baggage fees. <b>Spirit Airlines</b> charges $20–35 per carry-on bag, making it often cheaper to check in these bags. Don't forget the standard security restrictions regarding cabin baggage: liquids and gels must be in containers under 3.4 ounces (100&nbsp;mL) and be presented to security inside a transparent zip-lock bag. Razor blades, electric shavers, scissors, or anything else with a blade or sharp edge can not be carried in cabin baggage.</li>
<li>Pre-paying baggage charges <b>online</b> may give you a slight discount.</li>
<li>Frequent flier rewards programs may give a limited free baggage allowance and additional weight allowances. Some airlines have a branded credit card that offers similar perks.</li>
<li>Shipping luggage via UPS, FedEx or the U.S. Postal Service can work out cheaper than checking in bags.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Curbside check in</b>&nbsp;— $2–10 on top of any baggage or check-in fees, plus a tip is usually expected.</li>
<li><b>Food</b>&nbsp;— Small snacks (e.g., peanuts, potato chips, cookies) are generally free on all flights. On flights longer than 1.5–2 hours, prepackaged sandwiches, snacks, and occasionally hot food at may be available to buy at inflated prices. Flights from the east coast to Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Pacific territories (which can be over 8 hours each way) generally still feature traditional meal service.
<ul>
<li>All airlines allow you to bring your own food and non-alcoholic beverages on board. All except the smallest airports have an array of fast food and quick serve options in the terminal&nbsp;– but you can't bring liquids through the security checkpoint (and some airports do not allow food either). Airside food will inevitably be more expensive than that before security but will be far cheaper and better than what's available on board. Some cities, such as <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, regulate airport food vendors and limit how much air-side restaurants can markup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Drinks</b> — Free coffee, tea, water, juice and soda remain standard on all flights. Spirit Airlines, however, is an exception and charges for anything other than water. Alcoholic drinks cost $5–7.</li>
<li><b>In-flight entertainment</b> — Most U.S. carriers offer entertainment of one kind or another on longer domestic routes. Delta, JetBlue, Virgin America, and some of United's fleet offer free satellite TV in every seat, as well as movies on demand for purchase for $3–8. American has overhead screens showing movies and sitcom episodes on most longer routes, while US Airways and Southwest do not have in flight entertainment of any kind.</li>
<li><b>In-flight Wi-Fi</b> — Delta, JetBlue and Southwest offer in-flight Wi-Fi on nearly all their domestic fleets – US Airways and United offer it on select flights. Prices range from $5–20, depending on the airline, length of flight, and device (tablets and smartphones get a discount as they use less data) but the Internet connection is good for almost the entire flight (at least until told by crew to switch-off your devices). Daily and monthly passes are also available for less than $50/month. Most airlines do not offer power ports in economy, so be sure you're charged up or have extra batteries for your device. Mobile phones are usually permitted to be operated in-flight as long as they have been set to flight mode (which effectively shuts-off the mobile phone signal from your provider) before being airborne.</li>
<li><b>Pillows and blankets</b> are disappearing rapidly. Some airlines don't have them at all; some will charge you for them (but you get to keep after you pay); and one or two offer them for free (but you have to ask for them). Red-eye and long (&gt; 5 hour) flights are more likely to have free pillows and blankets. As always, check with your airline, and bring your own from home if you think you'll need them.</li>
<li><b>Lounge passes</b>: Each mainline carrier operates a network of lounges, such as Alaska Airline's "Board Rooms" and Delta's "Sky Clubs" – offering a quieter space to relax or work in, business amenities such as free wi-fi, fax services and conference rooms, as well as free finger foods, soft drinks, beer and wine. Frequent flyers buy annual memberships to these lounges, but any passenger can buy a day pass during check in or at the club itself, usually around $50, although sometimes less if you buy online. Only you can decide if the fee is worthwhile, but if you're in the upper elite tiers of an airline alliance (One World Sapphire or Emerald, Star Alliance Gold or SkyTeam Elite Plus) you may have access to these lounges for free with your frequent flyer card. For members in the highest tiers, this privilege may be extended to a traveling companion. Additionally international Business and First Class passengers can also access these lounges for free.</li>
<li><b>First-class upgrades</b>: Delta, United, and US Airways sell upgrades on a first come-first served basis at check-in if first class has open seats. This is one to actually consider, especially if you're checking bags – "day of" upgrades can sometimes be as low as $50 each way, less than the cost of two bag fees. You'd may be paying less to check your bags and additionally getting priority security screening, boarding and baggage handling, along with a larger seat and free refreshments on board.</li>
</ul><p>Most mainline carriers feature "cashless cabins" meaning any on-board purchases must be paid with either Visa or MasterCard (Delta also accepts American Express). Regional subsidiaries generally do still accept cash on board, although flight attendants may not be able to break large bills – hence the traditional request "exact change is appreciated." If you paid in advance for first class, checked baggage, meals, and alcoholic beverages are all included with the price of your ticket, as well as priority access to check-in agents and boarding.</p><p>Ironically, America's <a href="/wiki/Low-cost_airlines_in_North_America" title="Low-cost airlines in North America">discount airlines</a>, such as JetBlue, Southwest, and Virgin America sometimes have more amenities than the legacy carriers, and for many people may be a much better experience. JetBlue offers more than 45 channels of satellite television, non-alcoholic beverages and real snacks for free on every flight; Virgin America also has satellite TV, in addition to on demand dining (even in economy). On JetBlue your first checked bag is free ($35 for a second bag), and Southwest is the only U.S. carrier to still offer two checked bags per passenger free of charge. Virgin America charges for checked bags, but their fees are considerably lower than the legacies.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Security">Security</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=36" title="Edit section: Security">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>Security at U.S. airports is onerous, especially during busy holiday periods. Allow plenty of time and pack as lightly as possible. Adults must show <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids">approved picture ID</a></b>. Ensure that any liquids are held in containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces (100&nbsp;mL). The containers must all be placed within a single zippered plastic bag that is 1 quart (946&nbsp;mL) or less in size. Only one such bag, with however much liquid, is allowed per passenger.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="By_private_plane">By private plane</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37" title="Edit section: By private plane">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>The cost of chartering the smallest private jet begins at around $4000 per flight hour, with the cost substantially higher for larger, longer-range aircraft, and cheaper for smaller propeller planes. While private flying is by no means inexpensive, a family of four or more can often fly together at a cost similar to or even favorable to buying first-class commercial airline tickets, especially to smaller airports where scheduled commercial flights are at their most expensive, and private flying is at its cheapest. Though you may find it cheaper than flying a family of four first-class internationally, it is rarely the case, except when traveling from Western Europe.</p><p><b>Air Charter</b> refers to hiring a private plane for a one-time journey. <b>Jet Cards</b> are pre-paid cards entitling the owner to a specific number of flight hours on a specified aircraft. As all expenses are pre-paid on the card, you need not concern yourself with deadhead time, return flights, landing fees, etc.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_train_2">By train</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38" title="Edit section: By train">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><dl>

</dl><p>Except for certain densely populated corridors (mostly just the Northeast), passenger trains in the United States can be surprisingly scarce and relatively expensive. The national rail system, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.amtrak.com/">Amtrak</a> (1-800-USA-RAIL), provides service to many cities, offering exceptional sightseeing opportunities, but not particularly efficient inter-city travel, and is often just as expensive as a flight. In more urban locations, Amtrak can be very efficient and comfortable, but in rural areas delays are common. Plan ahead to ensure train travel between your destinations is available and/or convenient. They have promotional discounts of 15% for students and seniors, and a 30-day U.S. Rail Pass for international travelers only. If you plan to buy a regular ticket within a week of traveling, it pays to check the website for sometimes significant "weekly specials".</p><p>Amtrak offers many amenities and services that are lacking from other modes of transport. Amtrak's routes traverse some of America's most beautiful areas. Travelers with limited time may not find travel by train to be convenient, simply because the country is <i>big</i>, and that "bigness" is particularly evident in many of the scenic areas. For those with ample time, though, train travel offers an unparalleled view of the U.S., without the trouble and long-term discomfort of a rental (hire) car or the hassle of flying.</p><p>Trains running on the Washington D.C. to Boston <b>Northeast Corridor</b> (<i>Acela Express</i> and the <i>Regional</i>) and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg <b>Keystone Corridor</b> (<i>Keystone Service</i> and <i>Pennsylvanian</i>) generally run on time or very close to it. These two rail lines are electrified and owned by Amtrak or other commuter railways and are passenger only. Outside these two areas, Amtrak operates on freight lines and as a result must share track with a host railroad; this means you have about as good a chance of a delay as not. Delays are usually brief (trains make up time en route) but <b>have a contingency plan for being at least three hours late when traveling Amtrak</b>. Six-hour or longer delays, especially on long-distance routes, are not uncommon.</p><p>If you miss an Amtrak connection because your first train is late, Amtrak will book you onto the next available train (or in rare cases a bus) to your final destination. If your destination is on the Northeast Corridor, this isn't a big deal (departures are every hour) but in other parts of the country the next train may not be until tomorrow. If your reservations involved sleeper accommodations (Amtrak's First Class on their long-distance overnight trains) on either your late-arriving train or your missed connection, you will get a hotel voucher for the unplanned overnight stay. For coach class passengers in the same situation, you will not get a hotel voucher; your unplanned lodging arrangements and cost will be your responsibility. However, after your travel is completed, Amtrak's Customer Service will commonly offer travel vouchers of $100 or more off future Amtrak travel to inconvenienced passengers. This is true for all classes of service.</p><p>If you plan to board an Amtrak train at a location other than the train's initial place of departure, it's usually a good idea to call ahead before you leave for the station to see if the train is running on time.</p><p>A major Amtrak line in regular daily use by Americans themselves is the <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.amtrak.com/acela-express-train">Acela Express</a></i> line, running between Boston and Washington, D.C. It stops in New York City, <a href="/wiki/New_Haven" title="New Haven">New Haven</a>, Philadelphia and many other cities on the way. This line is electrified, with top speeds of 150 miles per hour (though the average speed is a good deal slower). The Acela Express has first class service, but can be quite expensive. Given the difficulty and expense of getting from the center of some of the major Northeastern cities to their respective airports, trains can sometimes be more convenient than air travel. There are also frequent but slower regional trains covering the same stations along the Northeast Corridor for lower fares.</p><p>During usual American vacation times, some long-distance trains (outside the Northeast) can sell out weeks or even months in advance, so it pays to book early if you plan on using the long-distance trains. Booking early also results in generally lower fares for all trains since they tend to increase as trains become fuller. On the other hand, same-day reservations are usually easy, and depending on the rules of the fare you purchased, you can change travel plans on the day itself without fees.</p><p>One major scenic long-distance train route, the <i>California Zephyr</i>, runs from <a href="/wiki/Emeryville" title="Emeryville">Emeryville</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Bay_Area_(California)" title="Bay Area (California)">Bay Area</a> of California to Chicago, via <a href="/wiki/Reno" title="Reno">Reno</a>, <a href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City" title="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</a> and <a href="/wiki/Denver" title="Denver">Denver</a>. The full trip takes around 60 hours, but has incredible views of the Western deserts, the Rocky Mountains, and the Great Plains, things that you just cannot see if you fly. Many of the sights on this route are simply inaccessible to cars. The trains run only once per day, and they usually sell out well in advance.</p><p>Amtrak's single most popular long-distance train is the Chicago-Seattle/Portland "Empire Builder" train via Milwaukee, <a href="/wiki/Twin_Cities" title="Twin Cities">St. Paul/Minneapolis</a>, Fargo, Minot, Glacier National Park, Whitefish, and Spokane. In FY2007, this train alone carried over 503,000 passengers.</p><p>Amtrak also provides reasonably speedy daily round trips between Seattle and Vancouver, Canada and several daily trips between Seattle and <a href="/wiki/Eugene" title="Eugene">Eugene</a>, Oregon on the <i>Amtrak Cascades</i> line.</p><p>Passengers traveling long distances on Amtrak may reserve a seat in coach (Economy class) or pay extra for an upgrade to a private sleeping compartment (there are no shared rooms), which also includes all meals in the dining car. Amtrak trains in the West feature a lounge car with floor to ceiling windows, which are perfect for sightseeing.</p><p>Separate from Amtrak, many major cities offer very reliable <b>commuter trains</b> that carry passengers to and from the suburbs or other relatively close-by areas. Since most Americans use a car for suburban travel, some commuter train stations have park and ride facilities where you can park your car for the day to use the commuter train to get to a city's downtown core where it may be more difficult to use a car due to traffic and parking concerns. Parking rates at the commuter train stations vary due (some facilities may be operated by third parties). Some commuter train systems and services though do not operate on weekends and holidays so it's best to check the system's website to plan ahead. Buy tickets <b>before</b> you board the train as you will either face a substantially more expensive fare or a hefty fine.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_boat_2">By boat</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=39" title="Edit section: By boat">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>America has the largest system of <b>inland waterways</b> of any country in the world. It is entirely possible to navigate around within the United States by boat. Your choices of watercraft range from self-propelled canoes and kayaks to elaborate houseboats and riverboat cruises.</p><p>Rivers and canals were key to developing the country, and traversing by boat gives you a unique perspective on the nation and some one of a kind scenery. Some examples of waterways open to recreational boating and/or scheduled cruises are:</p><ul>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.canals.ny.gov/exvac/index.html">The Erie Canal System</a></b> of New York State operates four canal systems consisting of 524 miles of waterway open for recreational and commercial use. The most famous of these canals is the Erie Canal, which starts around Albany and heads west to Buffalo. By navigating up the Hudson River from New York City, it is possible to go all the way to the Great Lakes and beyond via these waterways. Side trips to the Finger Lakes in Western New York or to Lake Champlain and Vermont are possible. Small watercraft, including canoes and kayaks, are welcome on these canals.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com/en/recreational/index.html">The St. Lawrence Seaway</a></b> is now the primary port of entry for large ships into North America. Recreational boaters are welcome, however, the Seaway is designed for very large craft and a minimum boat length of 6 meters applies. The Seaway starts in eastern Canada and goes to the Great Lakes.</li>
<li><b>The Mississippi River</b> There are two channels of navigation from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi. The Mississippi affords north-south access through the interior of the U.S. to the Gulf of Mexico and connects with all major interior waterways, including the <b>Missouri River</b>.</li>
</ul><p>Each year, many first time and beginning boaters successfully navigate these waterways. Do remember that any kind of boating requires some preparation and planning. In general, the Coast Guard, Canal and Seaway authorities go out of their way to help recreational boaters. They will also at times give instructions which you are expected to immediately obey. For example, small craft may be asked to give way to larger craft on canals, and weather conditions may require you to stop or change your route.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_car_2">By car</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40" title="Edit section: By car">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><dl>

</div><p>America's love affair with the automobile is legendary, and most Americans use a car when traveling within their city, and when traveling to nearby cities in their state or region.</p><p>Generally speaking, American cities were built for the automobile, so renting or bringing your own car is usually a very good idea. This applies even to very large cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami, where public transport is very limited and having a car is the most practical way of getting around. (The exceptions are New York City, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., where having your own car is not only unnecessary, but discouraged.) In most medium-sized American cities, everything is very spread out and public transportation thin. Taxis are often available, but if you're not at the airport, you may have to phone for one and wait a half-hour or so to be picked up, making similar arrangements to return. While most Americans are happy to give driving directions, don't be surprised if many aren't familiar with the local public transport options available.</p><p>Gas stations usually sell regional and national maps. Online maps with directions are available on several websites including MapQuest and Google Maps. Drivers can obtain directions by calling 1-800-Free411, which will provide them via text message. GPS navigation systems can be purchased for around $100, and car rental agencies often rent GPS units for a small additional fee. Many smartphones are now bundled with GPS navigation software that offers turn-by-turn directions. Even states that ban the use of hand-held phones by drivers often allow the use of GPS features, as long as the driver enters no data when in motion (check local laws in the places you will be traveling).</p><p>Unlike most of the world, the United States continues to use the imperial measurement system, meaning that road signs are in miles and miles per hour, and fuel is sold in gallons. If driving a car from Canada or Mexico, make sure you know the relevant conversion (1 mile is about 1.6&nbsp;km). Also, if you're planning to cross into the U.S. by car, read the owner's manual to see how to convert the speedometer from metric to U.S. units—almost all modern cars have speedometers that can display either set of units on demand (changing the speedometer will also change the odometer).</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Great_American_Road_Trip">Great American Road Trip</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41" title="Edit section: Great American Road Trip">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>A romantic appeal is attached to the idea of <b>long-distance car travel</b>; many Americans will tell you that you can't see the "real" America except by car. Given the scarcity of public transportation in most American cities, the loss of time traveling <i>between</i> cities by car rather than flying can be made up by the convenience of driving around <i>within</i> cities once you arrive. In addition, many of the country's major <b>natural attractions</b>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Canyon" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>, are almost impossible to get to without an automobile. If you have the time, a classic American road trip with a rented car (see below) is very easy to achieve. Just keep in mind that because of the distances, this kind of travel can mean many long days behind the wheel, so pay attention to the comfort of the car you use. A "coast-to-coast" trip with multiple drivers and minimal stops will take at least five days (four and a half if you have strong bladders).</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Interstate_system">Interstate system</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=42" title="Edit section: Interstate system">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><div class="thumb tright">

There's always a road going your way.</div>
</div>
</div><p>The United States is covered with a convenient system of <b>Interstate highways</b>. Interstates are always expressways (or "freeways")—that is, controlled access divided highways with no grade crossings, the equivalent of what Europeans call a "motorway". These roads connect all of the major population centers, and they make it easy to cover long distances—or get to the other side of a large city quickly.</p><p>Primary Interstates have one- or two-digit numbers, with odd ones running north-south (e.g. I-5) and even ones running east-west (e.g. I-80). Three-digit interstate numbers designate shorter, secondary routes. An odd first digit signifies a "spur" into or away from a city; an even first digit signifies a "loop" around a large city. The second two digits remain the same as the primary Interstate that travels nearby (e.g., I-495 is a loop that connects to I-95).</p><p>The vast majority of Interstates do not charge tolls, but several eastern states operate cross-state Interstate toll roads called <b>Turnpikes</b> (or the <b>Thruway</b> in New York). Other states have also started to implement tolls to defray their maintenance costs. While the majority of these tolls can still be paid in cash (no credit cards or traveler's checks), states are increasingly turning to electronic tolling. Ask your rental car agency or auto club about the tolling options available to you.</p><p>Speed limits on the interstate highways can vary from state to state, and also according to geography (for example, slower on mountain passes and within cities than on long straight rural sections). Posted speed limits can range from as low as 45 miles per hour (70&nbsp;km/h) in densely urban areas to as much as 85 miles per hour (135&nbsp;km/h) in rural stretches of Texas, but mostly they'll be between 65 and 75&nbsp;mph (105–120&nbsp;km/h). The speed limits (in miles per hour) are always clearly posted on interstates.</p><p>American drivers often drive 5 to 10 miles per hour (8–16&nbsp;km/h) over the posted speed limit; driving slower than the speed limit can actually be dangerous. A good rule of thumb is to avoid driving much faster than 5&nbsp;mph (8&nbsp;km/h) over the speed limit, and be sure that some other cars are always passing you; avoid being the fastest <i>or</i> the slowest vehicle. It is customary for the slowest traffic to keep to the right while faster traffic passes on the left. If you are pulled over by police for speeding, the excuse "Everyone else is speeding too" will not help. Highway Patrol officers are usually most concerned with the fastest drivers, so ensuring you are slower than the fastest speeders is one way to avoid their attention. If you are pulled over, be respectful, address the officer as "Officer," and express heartfelt regret at your excessive speed. You will nearly always get a ticket, but it never hurts to express regret as maybe you will get lucky and only receive a warning.</p><p>Many U.S. Interstate Highways, particularly around and through very large cities, will segregate the far left-hand lane or lanes and reserve them for high-occupancy use. These lanes are clearly signed, marked which white diamonds down the center of the lane, typically have double-white lines on the right, and are limited to vehicles with multiple occupants (usually two, sometimes three). High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes, called <i>HOV lanes</i>, are designed to ease congestion on Interstate freeways around large population centers during the very start and very end of the business day, also known colloquially as <i>Rush Hour.</i> Enforcement of these High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes typically coincides with rush-hour, from 7AM to 9AM, and again from 4PM to 6PM on weekdays. Driving in an HOV lane as the sole occupant of a vehicle during these times can result in a traffic citation and fine. Note that motorcycles are allowed to use HOV lanes in all states, even with only one rider.</p><p>Commercial rest areas were prohibited on the U.S. Interstate Highway system by the federal government. As a result, the vast majority of stopping points are state-operated rest areas with public toilets, parking, tourist information, vending machines, and a small picnic area. While there are no restaurants, gas stations, or other stores, some rest areas are equipped with vending machines. (A notable exception are tolled, limited-access highways such as Florida's Turnpike, where exiting would force you to pay a toll; service plazas with both food and gas are found on these highways every 20–40 miles [30–60&nbsp;km] or so.) Commercial traveler services tend to congregate on the local roads just off popular interstate exits, even if the exit is miles from the nearest population center. Sometimes you'll find a <b><a href="/wiki/Truck_stops" title="Truck stops">truck stop</a></b>, an establishment that caters to long-haul truckers but is open to all travelers; Truck stops provide several services all in one building, with a "greasy-spoon"-style restaurant, gas station, general store, and even hot showers. Signs on the highway will indicate the services available at upcoming exits, including gas, food, lodging, and camping, so you can choose a stopping point as you're driving.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Off_the_Interstates">Off the Interstates</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=43" title="Edit section: Off the Interstates">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>A secondary system of federal highways is the <b>U.S. Highway system</b>. U.S. Highways may be freeways on some sections, but they are often surface roads, sometimes with just one lane in each direction. U.S. Highways, which generally predate the Interstate system, tend to be older routes that lead through town centers. In many cases, Interstates were constructed roughly parallel to U.S. Highways to expedite traffic that wishes to bypass the cities and towns. If you don't mind stopping at traffic lights and dealing with pedestrians, U.S. Highways can lead you to some interesting off-the-beaten-path sights.</p><p>Each state is responsible for maintenance of the Interstates and U.S. Highways (despite the names), but each one also maintains its own system of <b>State Highways</b> (or <b>State Routes</b>) that form the bulk of the inter-community road network. State Highways are usually surface roads but may occasionally be freeways; you can generally count on them being well maintained (and plowed in the winter) and that following one will get you to some form of civilization sooner rather than later.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Driving_laws">Driving laws</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=44" title="Edit section: Driving laws">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><table class="pp_infobox" style="float:right; clear:right; margin-left: 1em; width:40%;" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="1" border="0">

A 5-light signal (left) indicating that both straight and left-turning traffic has the right of way. If just the green circle was displayed, without a green left arrow, left-turning traffic would have to yield to oncoming traffic.</div>
</div>
</div><p>As with the rest of North America, Americans drive on the right in left-hand drive vehicles and pass on the left. White lines separate traffic moving in the same direction and yellow lines separate opposing traffic. Right turn on red after coming to a complete stop and yielding is legal except at intersections where a sign prohibits it (like "No Turn on Red"), when there is a red right-turn arrow on a traffic light (in <i>most</i> states), and in New York City. Red lights and stop signs are always enforced at <i>all</i> hours in nearly all U.S. jurisdictions. At <b>all</b> intersections, vehicles must stop <i>behind</i> the thick, white line painted across the road and cannot block crosswalks. There are three ways of indicating how a left turn can be made. Some intersections will have a traffic light with red, yellow, &amp; green left arrows; in this case, treat the signal as you would any other. Many intersections have a 5-light traffic signal, with red, yellow, &amp; green circles and yellow &amp; green left arrows. When a green left arrow is displayed, even if the red circle is simultaneously lit, traffic has the right of way to turn left without the need to yield to oncoming traffic. When just the green circle is lit on a 5-light traffic signal, traffic turning left must yield to oncoming traffic. A few states use a pulsating yellow, left arrow to indicate that left-turning traffic must yield to oncoming traffic. When an intersection just has the simple red, yellow, &amp; green traffic signal, traffic turning left must yield to oncoming traffic when the light is green. In some urban areas, signals are found on onramps to freeways have a special traffic signal with only red &amp; green lights, which is used during periods of high traffic. At such signals, the light will turn green for a few seconds to allow one vehicle at a time (unless signs instruct otherwise) down the ramp to merge with freeway traffic. At some intersections, traffic lights aren't needed at certain times of the day when there is little traffic (especially at night) and the traffic light becomes either a pulsating red light—which is treated like a stop sign—or a pulsating yellow light which simply indicates caution (there is no need to slow or stop). In some areas, all-way stop signs are marked with these flashing red lights, one in each direction.</p><p>In many U.S. cities curbs are painted to reflect the ability to park at a particular location. The colors used and the meaning of the colors used varies from city to city. In general, red (and sometimes yellow) means "no parking" and blue designates handicapped parking only (with appropriate license plate or placard). In California, yellow curbs designate loading only (goods/cargo), white designates passenger pickup or dropoff, and green indicates there is a time limit for parking (look at signs for time limit). Elsewhere, the meaning of curb colors varies. Always follow parking signs and, if you are uncertain whether parking is allowed at a particular spot, it's best to park elsewhere than receive a parking ticket or even have your vehicle towed and impounded (which will result in a large fee to retrieve). A parked vehicle should never block a crosswalk, fire hydrant, or the entrance to a driveway/alley.</p><p>Most American drivers tend to drive calmly and safely in the sprawling residential suburban neighborhoods where the majority of Americans live. However, freeways around the central areas of big cities often become crowded with a significant proportion of "hurried" drivers, who will exceed speed limits, make unsafe lane changes, or follow other cars at unsafe close distances (known as "tailgating"). Enforcement of posted speed limits is somewhat unpredictable and varies widely from state to state. Not exceeding the pace of other drivers will usually avoid a troublesome citation. Beware of small towns along otherwise high-speed rural roads (and medium-speed suburban roads); the reduced speed limits found while going through such towns are strictly enforced.</p><p>Driving law is primarily a matter of state law and is enforced by state and local police. Fortunately, widespread adoption of provisions of the Uniform Vehicle Code, and federal regulation of traffic signs under the Highway Safety Act, means that most driving laws do not vary much from one state to the next. All states publish an official driver's handbook which summarizes state driving laws in plain English. These handbooks are usually available both on the Web and at many government offices.</p><p>AAA publishes a AAA/CAA Digest of Motor Laws, which is now <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://drivinglaws.aaa.com/">available online</a> for free. The Digest contains comprehensive summaries in plain English of all major driving laws that typically vary between states. The Digest's coverage includes all U.S states and all Canadian provinces.</p><p>International visitors age 18 and older can usually drive on their foreign driver's license for up to a year, depending on state law. Licenses that are not in English must be accompanied by an International Driving Permit (IDP) or a certified translation. Persons who will be in the United States for more than a year must obtain a driver's license from the state they are residing in. Written and practical driving tests are required, but they are usually waived for holders of valid Canadian, Mexican, and some European licenses.</p><p>Traffic signs often depend on the ability to read English words. Drivers who can read English will find most signs self-explanatory. (Progress toward adopting signs with internationally understood symbols is extremely slow; don't count on seeing any.) Distances and speeds will almost always be given in miles and miles per hour (MPH), without these units specified. Some areas near the Canadian and Mexican borders may feature road signs with distances in both miles and kilometers.</p><p>Traffic cameras are becoming common in some metropolitan areas and will issue automated traffic citations. Most traffic cameras are positioned at intersections and the most commonly issued citations are not coming to a complete stop when turning right on a red light, not stopping behind the stop line (thick, white line across the road before the crosswalk), and driving through a red light. As of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.iihs.org/laws/cameramap.aspx">July 2013</a>, 519 communities across 25 states &amp; D.C. use cameras at intersections for red light infractions and 129 jurisdictions across 13 states &amp; D.C. use cameras to catch speeding.</p><p>Police patrol cars vary in make, model, color, and livery from state to state and even town to town, but all are equipped with red and blue flashing lights and a siren. If you see the lights or hear the siren, pull to the right-hand shoulder of the road to let them by. If the patrol car is directly behind you, it's your car the officer is targeting; in that case, pull over as soon as it is practical for you to do so safely, even if this means driving some extra distance. It is extremely important that you pull off the road as soon as you are able. The officer will request to see your drivers license, the registration for the vehicle, and your proof of insurance coverage, and/or rental car documentation. Most traffic stops are recorded by a video camera in the trooper's patrol car, as well as a lapel mike on their person.

Renting a car usually costs anywhere from $20 and $100 per day for a basic sedan, depending on the type of car and location, with some discounts for week-long rentals. The major rental agencies are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.enterprise.com/">Enterprise Rent-A-Car</a> (+1 800 RENT-A-CAR); <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.hertz.com/">Hertz</a> (+1 800 230 4898); <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.avis.com/">Avis</a> (+1 800 230 4898); <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.Thrifty.com/">Thrifty Car Rental</a>; and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.Dollar.com/">Dollar Rent A Car</a>. There are no large national discount car rental agencies but in each city there is usually at least one. A couple discount car rental companies, usually restricted to areas of the country, are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.advantage.com/">Advantage Rent A Car</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.e-zrentacar.com/">E-Z Rent-A-Car</a> (+1 800 277 5171) and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.foxrentacar.com/">Fox Rent A Car</a>. The internet or the <i>Yellow Pages</i> are the easiest ways to find them. One widespread chain is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.rentawreck.com/">Rent-A-Wreck</a> (+1 800 944 7501). It rents used cars at significantly lower prices. Most rental agencies have downtown offices in major cities as well as offices at major airports. Not all companies allow picking up a car in one city and dropping it off in another (the ones that do almost always charge extra for the privilege); check with the rental agency when making your reservations.</p><p>Renting a car at an airport location can sometimes cost 3 times as much as renting the same car (from the same company) at a downtown location, but in other areas, the airport location will be cheaper. On-line travel websites such as Orbitz or Expedia can be useful to compare the best prices and make reservations.</p><p>Rental agencies accept a valid driver's license from your country, which must be presented with an International Drivers Permit if your license needs to be translated. You may wish to join some kind of <b>auto club</b> before starting a large American road trip, and having a cell phone is a very good idea. Most rental agencies have some kind of emergency road service program, but they can have spotty coverage for remote regions. The largest club in the United States is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.aaa.com/">AAA</a> (+1-800-391-4AAA), known as "Triple A". A yearly membership runs about $60. AAA members also get discounts at many hotels, motels, restaurants and attractions; which may make it worth getting a membership even if you don't drive. Alternatively, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.betterworldclub.com/">Better World Club</a> (+1-866-238-1137) offers similar rates and benefits as AAA with often timelier service and is a more eco-friendly choice (1% of revenue is donated to environmental cleanup programs). Some non-U.S. automobile clubs have affiliate relationships with AAA that allow their members to use AAA services. These include the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA), The Automobile Association in the UK, and ADAC in Germany.</p><p>Most Americans renting cars are covered for loss or damage to the rental car either by their credit card or their own private vehicle insurance policy. Without appropriate loss/damage waiver cover, you could be liable for the entire cost of the car should it be written off in an accident. Purchasing loss/damage waiver cover and supplemental liability insurance may add up to $30/day to the price of a rental, in some cases doubling the price of the rental. If you visit the car rental website and identify your country of origin, you may be given a quote which includes the loss/damage waiver and liability insurance for considerably less. Many <a href="/wiki/Travel_insurance" title="Travel insurance">travel insurance</a> policies include cover for some rental car damage – check your policy against the rental terms and conditions.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fuel">Fuel</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=46" title="Edit section: Fuel">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>Gasoline ("gas") is sold by the gallon, at stations that are primarily self-service (you must pump your own gas) with the exception of those in New Jersey and Oregon (where self-service is illegal). The American gallon is smaller than the UK gallon, and equals 3.785 liters. The U.S. octane scale is different from that used in Europe; a regular gallon of U.S. gasoline is rated at 87 octane, the equivalent of about 92 in Europe. In most states, gas stations offer a choice of three levels of octane: 87 (regular), 89 (midgrade or plus), and 91 (premium). Unless you are renting a luxury vehicle, your vehicle will likely require only 87 regular. If you are driving in the Rocky Mountains area, you may encounter stations that offer gas at lower octane ratings, most commonly 85 octane. This is suitable for use by 87-octane vehicles at high elevations, but if you're heading for lower elevations, be sure to fill up with 87 octane.</p><p>Diesel is not as common, but still widely used and available at most stations, especially those catering to truckers. Untaxed "offroad diesel", sold in rural areas for agricultural use, is dyed red and should not be used in cars, as there are heavy fines if you're caught.</p><p>Despite increasing petroleum prices worldwide and some increases in gas taxes, the American consumer-voter's attachment to his automobile, combined with abundant domestic oil reserves and relatively low taxes on gasoline, has kept retail fuel prices much lower than in many parts of the world. Prices fluctuate by region and season. As of May 2014, current prices are averaging near $3.65/gallon (equivalent to $0.97/liter) for regular and $3.95/gallon for diesel ($1.05/liter).</p><p>Gas prices vary dramatically from state to state based on a number of variables, primarily state sales tax rates (which are invariably included in the advertised price). The highest prices are usually found in Hawaii, Alaska, the West Coast, Illinois, and New York. The lowest are generally found in the south central U.S. A good rule of thumb to find cheaper gas is to venture away from the highway and city centers. There are numerous mobile apps written that will display the cheapest fuel prices within a set range.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_bus_2">By bus</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47" title="Edit section: By bus">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><dl>

</dl><p>Intercity bus travel in the United States is widespread, and while not available everywhere, there are at least three daily routes in every state. Service between nearby major cities is extremely frequent (e.g. as of July 2012 there are 82 daily buses, by seven operators, on an off-peak weekday each way between Boston-New York, an average of nearly one every 10 minutes during daytime hours). Many patrons use bus travel when other modes aren't readily available, as buses often connect many smaller towns with regional cities. The disadvantaged and elderly may use these bus lines, as automobile travel proves arduous or unaffordable for some. It's commonly considered a "lower class" way to travel, but is generally dependable, safe, affordable.</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound Bus Lines</a> (+1 800-229-9424) and several affiliated partners have the predominant share of American bus travel. Steep discounts are available to travelers who purchase their tickets 7–14 days in advance of their travel date. Greyhound buses typically runs in 5-7 hour segments, at which time all passengers must get off the bus so it can be serviced, even if it's the middle of the night. Continuing passengers are boarded before those just getting on. There are no reservations on Greyhound buses. All seating is on a first come, first served basis, with the exception of select cities, where you can pay a $5 fee for priority seating.</p><p>Internet-based buses are becoming very widespread. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://us.megabus.com">Megabus</a> offers inexpensive daily bus service across the country in several disconnected regions:</p><ul>

Some RVers love the convenience of being able to drive their home anywhere they like and enjoy the camaraderie that RV campgrounds offer. Other people dislike the hassles and maintenance issues that come with RVing. And don't even think about driving an RV into a huge metropolis such as New York. Still, if you want to drive extensively within the United States and are comfortable handling a big rig, renting an RV is an option you should consider.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_motorcycle">By motorcycle</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=49" title="Edit section: By motorcycle">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>The thrill and exhilaration of cross country travel are magnified when you go by motorcycle. <b>Harley-Davidson</b> is the preeminent American motorcycle brand and Harley operates a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.harley-davidson.com/en_US/Content/Pages/Try_a_Bike/rent-a-bike.html?locale=en_US">motorcycle rental program</a> for those licensed and capable of handling a full weight motorcycle. In some parts of the country, you can also rent other types of motorcycles, such as sportbikes, touring bikes, and dual-sport bikes. For those inexperienced with motorcycles, Harley and other dealerships offer classes for beginners. Wearing a helmet, although not required in all states, is always a good idea. The practice of riding between lanes of slower cars, also known as "lane-sharing" or "lane-splitting," is illegal, except in California where it is tolerated and widespread. Solo motorcyclists can legally use "high-occupancy vehicle" or "carpool" lanes during their hours of operation.</p><p>American enthusiasm towards motorcycles has led to a motorcycling subculture. <b>Motorcycle clubs</b> are exclusive clubs for members dedicated to riding a particular brand of motorcycle within a highly structured club hierarchy. <b>Riding clubs</b> may or may not be organized around a specific brand of bikes and offer open membership to anyone interested in riding. Motorcycle rallies, such as the famous one in <a href="/wiki/Sturgis" title="Sturgis">Sturgis</a>, South Dakota, are huge gatherings of motorcyclists from around the country. Many motorcyclists are not affiliated with any club and opt to ride independently or with friends. In general, motorcycling is seen as a hobby, as opposed to a practical means of transportation; this means, for example, that most American motorcyclists prefer not to ride in inclement weather. However you choose to ride, and whatever brand of bike you prefer, motorcycling can be a thrilling way to see the country.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_thumb">By thumb</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=50" title="Edit section: By thumb">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class="thumb tright">

</div><p>A long history of <a href="/wiki/Hitchhiking" title="Hitchhiking">hitchhiking</a> comes out of the U.S., with record of automobile hitchhikers as early as 1911. Today, hitchhiking is nowhere near as common, but there are some nevertheless who still attempt short or cross-country trips. The laws related to hitchhiking in the U.S. are most covered by the <i>Uniform Vehicle Code</i> (UVC), adopted with changes in wording by individual states. In general, it is legal to hitchhike throughout the majority of the country, if not standing within the boundaries of a highway (usually marked by a solid white line at the shoulder of the road) and if not on an Interstate highway prohibiting pedestrians.</p><p>In many states Interstate highways do not allow foot traffic, so hitchhikers must use the entrance ramps. In a few states it is allowed or tolerated (unless on a toll road). Oklahoma, Texas and Oregon are a few states that do allow pedestrians on the highway shoulder, although not in <i>some</i> metropolitan areas. Oklahoma allows foot traffic on <i>all</i> free interstates, but <i>not</i> toll roads and Texas only bans it on toll roads (and on free Interstates within the city of El Paso). Oregon only bans it in the Portland metro area. Missouri only bans it within <a href="/wiki/Kansas_City" title="Kansas City">Kansas City</a> and <a href="/wiki/St._Louis" title="St. Louis">St. Louis</a> city limits.</p><p>Hitchhiking has become much less popular due to increasing wariness of the possible dangers (fueled in part by sensational stories in the news media). International travelers to the U.S. should avoid this practice unless they have either a particularly strong sense of social adventure or extremely little money. Even many Americans themselves would only feel comfortable "thumbing a ride" if they had a good knowledge of the locale.</p><p><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://craigslist.org">Craigslist</a></b> has a rideshare section that sometimes proves useful for arranging rides in advance.

</tbody></table><p>Almost all Americans speak <b>English</b>. They generally use a standard accent (native to the Midwest), popularized in the 20th century by radio, TV and movies. In many areas, especially the South and Texas, in New England, in New York City, and in the upper Midwest, you'll find distinctive regional accents and dialects. Nowhere should this pose any problem to a visitor, as Americans <b>often admire foreign accents</b> and most will approximate the standard accent to help you understand them, or try to speak your language if they can.</p><p>Even so, visitors are generally <b>expected to speak and understand English</b>. While many Americans study a foreign language in school, few advance past the basics. The end result is that many Americans know only a few words at best of a foreign language, even if they studied that language in school. A growing number of popular tourist sites have signs in other languages, but only English is certain to be available at any given location.</p><p>American English differs somewhat from the English spoken in other parts of the English speaking world. These differences are mostly minor, and primarily around minor spelling differences as well as pronunciation. See the article on <a href="/wiki/English_language_varieties" title="English language varieties">English language varieties</a> for a detailed discussion.</p><p>Due primarily to immigration from Latin America, the United States has the fifth-largest <b>Spanish</b> speaking population in the world. Spanish is the primary second language in many parts of the United States such as California, the Southwest, Texas, Florida, and the metropolitan areas of Chicago and New York City. Many of these areas have Spanish-language radio and television stations, with local, national and Mexican programs. Many of the larger financial institutions and offices of the federal government also provide services in Spanish.</p><p>Spanish is the first language of Puerto Rico and a large minority of residents on the mainland, particularly in the western states. Spanish speakers in the United States are primarily Puerto Ricans, or first- and second-generation immigrants from Latin America. As a result, the Spanish spoken is almost invariably a Latin American or Puerto Rican dialect. Although it's rare to be in areas where no one speaks English, a good handle on Spanish can make communication easier in some areas.</p><p>French is the primary second language in rural areas near the border with <a href="/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>, in some areas of Louisiana, and among West African immigrants, but is not widespread elsewhere. In southern Florida, Haitian immigrants primarily speak <a href="/wiki/Haitian_Creole_phrasebook" title="Haitian Creole phrasebook">Haitian Creole</a>, a separate language derived from French, as their second language, although a substantial number also speak French.</p><p>Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, some products now have trilingual packaging in English, Spanish, and French for sale throughout the entire trade bloc, especially household cleaning products and small electric appliances. However, the vast majority of consumer products are labeled only in English, meaning that a rudimentary grasp of English is essential for shopping.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_phrasebook" title="Hawaiian phrasebook">Hawaiian</a> is the native language of <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, although English is the most widely spoken language and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_phrasebook" title="Japanese phrasebook">Japanese</a> is also widely spoken there. In the various Chinatowns in major cities, <a href="/wiki/Cantonese_phrasebook" title="Cantonese phrasebook">Cantonese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chinese_phrasebook" title="Chinese phrasebook">Mandarin</a> are common. Smaller immigrant groups also sometimes form their own pockets of shared language, including Russian, Italian, Greek, Arabic, Tagalog, Korean, Vietnamese, and others. Chicago, for instance, is the city with the second largest ethnic Polish population in the world, behind <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>. The Amish, who have lived in Pennsylvania and Ohio for generations, speak a dialect of German.</p><p>Some Native Americans speak their respective native languages, especially on reservations in the west. However, despite efforts to revive them, many Native American languages are endangered, and people who speak them as their first language are few and far between. Navajo speakers in Arizona and New Mexico are an exception to this, but even a clear majority among them speak and understand English too.</p><p>Bottom line: unless you're certain you'll be in an area populated with recent immigrants, traveling in the United States without a firm grasp of English is a significant challenge.</p><p><b>American Sign Language</b>, or <b>ASL</b> is the dominant sign language in the United States. When events are interpreted, they will be interpreted in ASL. Users of French Sign Language and other related languages may find ASL intelligible, as they share much vocabulary, but users of Japanese Sign Language, British Sign Language, or Auslan will not. Closed-captioning on television is widespread, but far from ubiquitous. Many theaters offer FM loops or other assistive listening devices, but captioning and interpreters are rarer.</p><p>For the blind, many signs and displays include <b>Braille</b> transcriptions of the printed English. Larger restaurant chains, museums, and parks may offer Braille menus and guidebooks, but you'll likely have to ask for them.</p></div>

And each state has its own <b>state parks</b> that can be just as good as the federal versions. Most all of these destinations, federal or state, have an admission fee, but it all goes toward maintenance and operations of the parks, and the rewards are well worth it.</p><p>Those aren't your only options, though. Many of America's natural treasures can be seen without passing through admission gates. The world-famous <a href="/wiki/Niagara_Falls_(New_York)" title="Niagara Falls (New York)">Niagara Falls</a> straddle the border between Canada and the U.S.; the American side lets you get right up next to the onrush and feel the power that has shaped the Niagara gorge. The "purple majesty" of the Rocky Mountains can be seen for hundreds of miles in any direction, while the placid coastal areas of the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic have relaxed Americans for generations. And, although they are very different from each other, Hawaii and Alaska are perhaps the two most scenic states; they don't just <i>have</i> attractions—they <i>are</i> attractions.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_attractions">Historical attractions</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=54" title="Edit section: Historical attractions">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>Americans often have a misconception of their country as having little history.

<li><b>Music</b> — Mid-size to large cities often draw big ticket concerts, especially in large outdoor amphitheaters. Small towns sometimes host concerts in parks with local or older bands. Other options include music festivals such has <a href="/wiki/San_Diego" title="San Diego">San Diego's</a> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.street-scene.com/">Street Scene</a></b> or <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sxsw.com">South by Southwest</a></b> in <a href="/wiki/Austin" title="Austin">Austin</a>. Classical music concerts are held year round and performed by semi-professional and professional symphonies. Boston, for instance, occasionally puts on free concerts in the Public Park. Many cities and regions have unique sounds. <a href="/wiki/Nashville" title="Nashville">Nashville</a> is known as <i>Music City</i> because of the large number of country artists that live in the city. It's home to the <b>Grand Ole Opry</b>, one of the most famous music venues in the country. Country music is popular throughout the U.S. but is particularly concentrated in the South and rural West. Seattle is the home of grunge rock. Many of the most popular bands are based out of Los Angeles due to the large entertainment presence and concentration of record companies.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><b>Theatre</b> - America is considered to be the spiritual home of musical theatre, and many of the world's most famous musicals have had a run on Broadway in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a> at one time or another. No trip to the East Coast of the United States will be complete without catching at least one musical at Broadway. Alternatively, for those who prefer classical music, the United States is also home to one of the world's premier opera companies, the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Other well-regarded opera companies include the San Francisco Opera in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and the Lyric Opera of Chicago in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><b>Marching Band</b> — In addition to traditional music concerts, a quintessential American experience is the marching band festival. One can find these events almost every weekend between September and Thanksgiving throughout the country and again from March to June in California. Check local event listings and papers to find specifics. Also notable is the Bands of America Grand National Championship held every autumn in Indianapolis. Those looking to see the best of the best should acquire tickets to the "finals" performance, where the ten best bands of the festival compete for the championship. This event is now held at the Lucas Oil Stadium. Both "street" or parade marching bands as well as "field" or show bands are found at almost every high school and university in America.</li>

With 30 teams playing 162 games per team per season and the cheapest seats usually $10-20, this is possibly the best sporting event for international travelers to watch. There are also several hundred minor league teams scattered across the U.S.; while quality of the games are lower, prices are cheaper (even free in a few leagues).

<li><b>College sports</b> — One rare feature of the United States sports landscape, as compared to that of other nations, is the extent to which sports are associated with educational institutions. In many regions of the country, local college or university teams, especially in football and men's basketball, enjoy followings that rival or surpass those of major professional teams. The primary governing body for U.S. college sports is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ncaa.com">NCAA</a>), which has over 1,000 member schools, including essentially all of the country's best-known colleges and universities. The college football season runs from roughly September 1 through mid-December, with postseason bowl games running into early January. The basketball regular season begins in mid-November and ends in late February or early March, followed by conference tournaments and then national post-season tournaments that run through early April. The NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, popularly known as "March Madness" (an NCAA trademark), is especially widely followed even by casual sports fans.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><b>High school sports</b> — The U.S. association with sports and education isn't limited to colleges and universities. Many communities take great pride in their high school sports teams, and especially in smaller locales, high school sports are a major part of local culture. During the school year (August to May), a high school game can be a great (and cheap) way to get a major dose of local culture. The most popular sports are usually football and boys' basketball (and to a lesser extent girls' basketball), plus hockey in New England and the upper Midwest. In some areas, a particular high school sport enjoys an elevated cultural place. Examples include football in Texas, basketball in Indiana, hockey in Minnesota, and wrestling in Iowa.</li>

The most recent designs of U.S. $100, $50, $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1 bills. Older styles are still frequently seen in circulation.</div>
</div>
</div><p>The official U.S. currency is the <b>United States dollar</b> (<b>$</b>), divided into 100 <b>cents</b> (<b>¢</b>). The dollar is colloquially known as the <b>buck</b> so 5 bucks means $5. Foreign currencies are almost never accepted. Some major hotel chains may accept traveler's cheques in other currencies. The Canadian dollar can generally be used close to the border; it is sometimes accepted at larger stores up to 100 miles from the border. The Mexican peso can also be used in border towns (El Paso, Laredo, etc.), but you'll get better rates by exchanging it before leaving Mexico.</p><p>Common American bills are for $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100, with $2 bills practically never seen in circulation. The $100 and sometimes $50 bills are too valuable for small transactions, and may be refused. All the bills are the same size. All $1 and $2 bills and older $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills are greenish and printed with black and green ink. Newer versions of the $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills are slightly more colorful. Banknotes never expire and several designs of each note can circulate together. However, some retailers may refuse older bills in higher denominations ($100, $50, and maybe $20) which lack the anti-counterfeiting features (watermarks, security ribbon, microprinting) that staff are trained to look for.</p><p>The standard coins are the <b>penny</b> (1¢, copper color), the chunky <b>nickel</b> (5¢, silver color), the tiny <b>dime</b> (10¢, silver color) and the ridged-edge <b>quarter</b> (25¢, silver color). These coins only have their values written in words, not figures, e.g. "quarter dollar", rather than "25¢". The 10¢ coin is labeled "one dime", not "ten cents". When it comes to value, size doesn't matter: the dime is the smallest coin, followed by the penny, nickel, and quarter. <b>Half dollar</b> (50¢, silver) and <b>dollar</b> ($1, silver or gold) coins exist but are uncommon. Coin-operated machines usually only accept nickels, dimes, and quarters, and dollar bills, though vending machines may also accept dollar coins; larger vending machines, such as for buses or postal stamps, may take $5, $10, and even $20 bills. Canadian coins are sized similarly, but machines usually reject them. Humans generally won't notice (or care about) a few small Canadian coins (particularly pennies, but also nickels, dimes, and even quarters) mixed with American, at least not in the northern parts of the country.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Currency_exchange_and_banking">Currency exchange and banking</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=61" title="Edit section: Currency exchange and banking">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p><b>Currency exchange</b> centers are rare outside the downtowns of major coastal and border cities, and international airports. Some banks can provide currency exchange services.</p><p>Opening a bank account in the US is a fairly straightforward process, and there are no restrictions on foreigners owning bank accounts in the US. The largest retail banks are <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.chase.com">Chase</a></b>, <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.bankofamerica.com">Bank of America</a></b>, <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.wellsfargo.com">Wells Fargo</a></b>, and <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.citibank.com">Citibank</a></b>. Many parts of the country, such as Hawaii, are poorly served by the big retail banks and are dominated by local banks.</p><p><b>ATMs</b> can handle foreign bank cards or credit cards bearing Visa/Plus or MasterCard/Cirrus logos. They generally charge about $2.50 to cards issued by other banks, though this is often waived for cards issued outside the U.S. Smaller ATMs in restaurants etc. often charge higher fees (up to $5). Some ATMs (such as those at Sheetz gas stations and government buildings such as courthouses) have no fee. Another option is withdrawing cash (usually up to $40 over the cost of your goods) when making a debit-card purchase at a large discount store such as Walmart or Target, or at many supermarkets. Stores almost never charge a fee for this service, though the bank that issued your card may.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Credit_and_debit_cards">Credit and debit cards</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=62" title="Edit section: Credit and debit cards">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>Major credit cards such as Visa and MasterCard (and their debit card affiliates) are widely used and accepted. Nearly all large retailers will accept credit cards for transactions of all sizes, even as small as one or two dollars. However, some small businesses and independently-owned stores specify a minimum amount of money (usually $2–5, but can legally charge up to $10 minimum) for credit card use, as such transactions cost them around $0.30–0.50 (this practice is also common at bars when opening a tab). Almost all sit-down restaurants, hotels, and shops will accept credit and debit cards; those that do not post a sign saying "CASH ONLY." Other cards such as American Express and Discover are also accepted, but not as widely. Many retailers have a window sticker or counter sign showing the logos of the four big U.S. credit cards: Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, and Discover.</p><p>Only a few high-end boutique stores in major cities also have window stickers for foreign cards like JCB and China UnionPay. However, both JCB and China UnionPay have alliances with Discover, so they can be used at any retailer that accepts Discover cards.</p><p>When making large purchases, it is typical for U.S. retailers to ask to see some form of photo identification. Shops may also ask for photo identification for foreign issued cards. In certain circumstances, credit/debit cards are the only means to perform a transaction. Hence if you do not have one, you can purchase a prepaid card or gift card with Visa, MasterCard or AmEx logo for yourself in a good number of stores but you may need to provide identification before the card is activated.</p><p>Transaction authorization is made by signing a paper sales slip or a computer pad, although many retailers will waive the signature requirement for small purchases. The U.S. is in the process of implementing the EMV "chip-and-PIN" credit card authorization system used overseas. The deadline for financial institutions to convert to using only EMV chip cards is October 2015. Since chip-and-PIN card readers were virtually non-existent in early 2014 and most financial institutions don't plan to begin replacing existing cards until late 2014/early 2015, don't expect to find many compatible card readers until the 2015 deadline draws near. After October 2015, retailers may still require a signature on a paper slip or computer pad as opposed to using a PIN (as it's the "chip" technology that's being mandated).</p><p>Gas station pumps, selected public transportation vending machines, and some other types of automated vending machines often have credit/debit card readers. Many gas station pumps and some automated vending machines that accept credit cards ask for the ZIP code (i.e., postal code) of the U.S. billing address for the card, which effectively prevents them from accepting foreign cards (they are unable to detect a foreign card and switch to PIN authentication). At gas stations, you can use a foreign issued card by paying the station attendant inside. If you live in Canada and are using a card with the MasterCard logo, you can use it at all U.S. pumps that require a ZIP code prompt by entering the digits of your postal code (ignoring letters and spaces) and adding two zeroes to the end. When using a debit card, some stations will place a hold on your account for a specified amount (a notice will be present on the pump, typically $75) and then update the charge once you've filled up (but there is often a 1-2 delay between removing the "hold" and updating the amount charged).</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gift_cards">Gift cards</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=63" title="Edit section: Gift cards">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>Each major commercial establishment (e.g. store, restaurant, online service) with a statewide, regional, nationwide or online presence makes its own gift card available to consumers for use at any of its establishments nationwide or its online store. In spite of the word "gift" in gift card, you can actually purchase and use these cards for yourself. A gift card for a certain establishment can be purchased at any of the establishment's branches. Supermarkets and pharmacies also have a variety of gift cards from different stores, restaurants and other services. Once these are purchased by you or given to you by friends, you can use a particular store or restaurant's gift card at any of its branches nationwide or online store for any amount. In case funds in the gift card are insufficient, you can use other payment methods to pay for the balance (like cash, credit card, a 2nd gift card particular to the establishment). The gift card also has instructions on how to check your remaining balance online. Gift cards will not likely work in branches outside the U.S.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sales_tax">Sales tax</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=64" title="Edit section: Sales tax">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>There is no nationwide sales tax (such as VAT or GST), although nationwide taxes are levied on certain goods, notably motor fuels (gasoline and diesel). As a result, state or local taxes cannot be refunded by customs agents upon your leaving the U.S.</p><p>Most states have a retail <b>sales tax</b> of roughly 3–10% (4–6% is typical). A few have no state sales tax, but allow local city governments to collect sales taxes. Most states also levy substantial <b>sin taxes</b> on liquor or cigarettes. Taxes are <i><b>almost never included in posted prices</b></i> (except for those on gasoline/diesel, and in most states, alcoholic beverages consumed on-premises). Instead it will calculated when you come to pay. Groceries and a variety of other "necessities" are usually exempt, but almost any other retail transaction – including restaurant meals – will incur sales tax.</p><p>Regional price variations, indirect hotel and business taxes, etc. will usually have more impact on a traveler's wallet than the savings of seeking out a low-sales-tax or no-sales-tax destination. Many cities also impose sales taxes, and certain cities have tax zones near airports and business districts that are designed to exploit travelers. Thus, sales taxes can vary up to 2% in a matter of a few miles.</p><p>However, even accounting for the burden of sales taxes, U.S. retail prices still tend to be much lower than in many other countries. The U.S. has not implemented any form of value-added tax, where each segment in the supply chain is required to charge tax on the value it adds towards the final product. Rather, U.S. sales taxes are charged <i>only</i> by the retailer at the time of the sale of the final product to the consumer.</p><p>Internationally renowned luxury brands are hard to find in the no-sales-tax states. Their boutiques are traditionally found in the largest and wealthiest states: <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_(state)" title="New York (state)">New York</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> and <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> (all of which have sales taxes). However, a limited range of their wares may be found in local luxury retailers in the no-sales-tax states.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Places_for_shopping">Places for shopping</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=65" title="Edit section: Places for shopping">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p><b>Shopping malls</b> and <b>shopping centers</b>. America is the birthplace of the modern enclosed "shopping mall" as well as the open-air "shopping center". In addition, American suburbs have miles and miles of small <b>strip malls</b>, or long rows of small shops with shared parking lots, usually built along a high-capacity road. Large cities still maintain central shopping districts that can be navigated on public transport, but pedestrian-friendly shopping streets are uncommon and usually small. Most medium-sized suburban towns contain at least one shopping mall containing one or more department stores as well as restaurants and retail establishments. They also contain one or more strip corridors containing strip malls, auto dealerships, and office space.</p><p><b>Outlet centers</b>. The U.S. pioneered the factory outlet store, and in turn, the outlet center, a shopping mall consisting primarily of such stores. Outlet centers are found along major Interstate highways outside of most American cities.</p><p><b>Major retailers</b>. American retailers tend to have some of the longest business hours in the world, with chains like Walmart and 7-Eleven often featuring stores open 24/7 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Department stores and other large retailers are usually open from 10AM to 9PM most days, and during the winter holiday season, may stay open as long as 8AM to 11PM. Most supermarkets are open late into the evening, usually until at least 9PM. The U.S. does not regulate the timing of sales promotions as in other countries. U.S. retailers often announce sales during all major holidays, and also in between to attract customers or jettison merchandise. American retail stores are gigantic compared to retail stores in other countries, and are a shoppers' dream come true. As such, they typically offer a wide range of items. Department stores typically sell clothing, shoes, furniture, perfume and jewelry. Supermarkets sell produce, meats, fish, paper products, canned goods, milk, liquor and cigarettes. In poor neighborhoods or on freeways adjacent to gas stations, there are often convenience stores that offer a small range of cooked food, soda, sundries and cigarettes, albeit at rates not competitive with supermarkets.</p><p><b>Farmer's markets</b>. Unlike many other countries, the United States does not have large open-air markets open daily. Instead, urban and suburban cities have farmer's markets where growers sell fruits and vegetables directly to consumers. These events are typically held once weekly and take place in a cordoned-off street or parking lot.</p><p><b>Garage sales</b>. On weekends, it is not uncommon to find families selling no longer needed household items in their driveway, garage, or yard. If you see a driveway full of stuff on a Saturday, it's likely a garage sale. Check it out; one person's trash may just be your treasure. Bargaining is expected and encouraged.</p><p><b>Flea markets</b>. Flea markets (called "swap meets" in Western states) have dozens if not hundreds of vendors selling all kinds of usually inexpensive merchandise. They sometimes take place in convention centers, but usually take place in large suburban parking lots. Some flea markets are highly specialized and aimed at collectors of a particular sort; others just sell all types of items. Again, bargaining is expected.</p><p><b>Auctions</b>. Americans did not invent the auction but may well have perfected it. The fast paced, sing-song cadence of a country auctioneer, selling anything from farm animals to estate furniture, is a special experience, even if you have no intention of buying. In big cities, head to the auction chambers of Christie's or Sotheby's, and watch paintings, antiques and works of art sold in a matter of minutes at prices that go into the millions.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Major_U.S._retail_chains">Major U.S. retail chains</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=66" title="Edit section: Major U.S. retail chains">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>According to Deloitte, the largest fashion goods retailer in both the U.S. and the entire world is Macy's, Inc., which operates over 800 Macy's midrange department stores in 45 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam, plus a smaller number of upscale Bloomingdale's stores. Nordstrom is another upscale department store that is also found in most states. Midrange stores include Kohl's, Sears, The Gap, and JCPenney, while the lower end is dominated by Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and Old Navy. Department stores are normally found in suburban towns, often in shopping malls, though a few can be found in downtowns or smaller rural towns.</p><p>General discount stores like Walmart, Target, and Kmart are ubiquitous. Many discount stores, in addition to selling clothing and sundries, have either a small grocery section or a full supermarket; in fact, Walmart is the country's largest grocer, as well as being its largest retail chain. The three largest supermarket chains are Kroger, Safeway, and SuperValu, but they operate under legacy regional nameplates in many states (for example, Vons and Ralphs in California, and Cub in Minnesota). There are smaller regional supermarkets such as the A&amp;P on the East Coast and Albertsons in the Rocky Mountain States. A number of American suburbs have high-end markets such as Whole Foods that sell more expensive items such as wine and organic produce. The dominant warehouse club chain is Costco, whose biggest competitor is Sam's Club (operated by Walmart). The three big pharmacy chains are CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid, though almost all discount stores and many supermarkets also contain a small pharmacy. Most urban and suburban towns contain several supermarkets or pharmacies, and more often than not a Walmart or other “big box” retailer.</p><p>A special note on pharmacies in discount stores and supermarkets: Generally, discount stores will group many items sold at pharmacies—over-the-counter medications, dental care products, cosmetics, hair care supplies, soap, first aid supplies, and the like—in one section of the store near the pharmacy counter. This is not the case in many supermarkets; these items are often split among two or more areas of the store. (Walmart uses the discount-store pharmacy model both in its discount stores and its supermarket-only Walmart Markets.)</p><p>In several areas of the retail sector, ruthless consolidation has resulted in only one surviving nationwide chain, which may compete with a number of smaller regional chains. Examples include bookstores (Barnes &amp; Noble), electronics (Best Buy), convenience stores (7-Eleven) and housewares (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond).</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Costs">Costs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=67" title="Edit section: Costs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class="thumb tright">

</div><p>Unless you live in Australia, Canada, Europe or Japan, the U.S. is generally <b>expensive</b>, but there are ways to limit the damage. Many Europeans come to the U.S. for shopping (especially electronics). While prices in the U.S. are lower than in many European countries, keep in mind that you will be charged taxes/tariffs on goods purchased abroad. Additionally, electronics may not be compatible with standards when you return (<a href="/wiki/Electrical_systems" title="Electrical systems">electrical, DVD region</a>, etc.). As such, the savings you may find shopping in the U.S. may easily be negated upon your return. Furthermore, your U.S.-bought item may not be eligible for warranty service in your home country.</p><p>A bare bones budget for camping, hostels, and cooking your food could be $30–50/day, and you can double that if you stay at motels and eat at cheap cafés. Add on a rental car and hotel accommodation and you'll be looking at $150/day and up. There are regional variations too: large cities like <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a> and <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> are expensive, while prices go down in rural areas. Most U.S. cities have suburbs with good hotels that are often much more affordable than those in the city center and enjoy lower crime rates. Thus, if you plan to rent a car and drive between several major cities on a single visit to the U.S., it is usually a better idea to stay at safe suburban hotels with free parking, as opposed to downtown hotels that charge exorbitant parking fees. Additionally, if you have generous friends from the U.S. who will give gift cards to you for some reason, the cards can help you defray some of the costs.</p><p>If you intend to visit any of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_National_Parks" title="United States National Parks">National Park Service</a> sites, such as the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Canyon" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> or <a href="/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park" title="Yellowstone National Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, it is worth considering the purchase of a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm">National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass</a>. This costs $80 and gives access to almost all of the federally administered parks and recreation areas for one year. Considering the price of admission to many parks is at least $20 <i>each</i>, if you visit more than a few of them, the pass will be the cheaper solution. You can trade in receipts from individual entries for 14 days at the entrance to the parks to upgrade to an annual pass, if you find yourself cruising around and ending up visiting more parks than expected.</p><p>Many hotels and motels offer discounts for members of certain organizations which anyone can join, such as AAA (formerly the American Automobile Association). If you're a member, or are a member of a club affiliated with AAA (such as the Canadian Automobile Association, The Automobile Association in the UK, or ADAC in Germany), it's worth asking at check-in.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tipping">Tipping</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=68" title="Edit section: Tipping">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>Tipping in America is widely used and expected. While Americans themselves often debate correct levels and exactly who deserves to be tipped, generally accepted standard rates are:</p><ul>
<li>Hairdressers, other personal services: 10–15%</li>
<li>Bartenders: $1 per drink if inexpensive or 15–20% of total</li>
<li>Bellhops: $1–2 per bag ($3–5 minimum regardless)</li>
<li>Hotel doorman: $1 per bag (if they assist), $1 for calling a cab</li>
<li>Shuttle bus drivers: $2–5 (optional)</li>
<li>Private car &amp; limousine drivers: 15–20%</li>
<li>Parking valet: $1–3 for retrieving your car (unless there's already a fee for parking)</li>
<li>Housekeeping in hotels: $1–2 per day for long stays or $5 minimum for very short stays (optional)</li>
<li>Food delivery (pizza, etc.): $2–5, 15–20% for larger orders</li>
<li>Bicycle messengers: $3–5</li>
<li>Tour guides / activity guides: $5–$10 if he or she was particularly funny or informative.</li>
<li>Taxis: Tips of 10–20% are expected in both yellow cabs as well as livery cabs. A simple way of computing the tip is to add 10% of the fare and round up from there. Thus, if the meter reads $6.20, you pay $7 and if the meter reads $6.50, you pay $8. Always tip more for better service (for example, if the cabbie helps you with your bags or stroller). Leave a small tip if the service is lousy (for example, if the cabbie refuses to turn on the AC on a hot day). For livery cabs, if you hail the cab on the street and negotiate the fare in advance, then pay the negotiated amount plus an extra $1–2.</li>
<li>Full-service restaurants: 15–20%. Many restaurants include a mandatory service charge for larger groups, in which case you do not need to tip an additional amount&nbsp;– check the bill.</li>
</ul><p>It is important to keep in mind that the legal minimum wage for restaurant waitstaff and other tip-earners is quite low (just $2.13/hour before taxes), with the expectation that tips bring them up to a "normal" minimum wage. Thus, in restaurants (and certain other professions) a tip is not just a way to say "thank you" for service, but is an essential part of a server's wages.</p><p>Remember that while it is expected for you to tip normally for adequate service, you are never obliged to tip if your service was truly awful. If you receive exceptionally poor or rude service and the manager does not correct the problem when you bring it to their attention, a deliberately small tip (one or two coins) will express your displeasure more clearly than leaving no tip at all.</p><p>If paying your bill by cash, leave a cash tip on the table when you leave (there is no need to hand it over personally or wait until it's collected), or if paying by credit card you can add it directly to the charge slip when you sign it. Look carefully, as the slip will generally inform you whether a 15% gratuity has already been added.</p><p>Tipping is not expected at restaurants where patrons stand at a counter to place their order and receive their food (such as fast-food chains). Some such restaurants may have a "tip jar" by the cash register, which may be used wholly at the customer's discretion in appreciation of good service. Some tipping at a cafeteria or buffet is expected since the wait staff often clears the table for you and provides refills of drinks and such.</p><p>The majority of jobs not mentioned here are not customarily tipped, and would likely refuse them. Retail employees, or those in service positions which require high qualifications (such as doctors or dentists) are good examples. <i>Never</i> try to offer any kind of tip to a government employee of any kind, especially police officers; this could be construed as attempted bribery (a felony offense) and might cause serious legal problems.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Buying_a_mobile_phone">Buying a mobile phone</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=69" title="Edit section: Buying a mobile phone">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>A popular idea is to buy a hot new mobile phone in the U.S. to use on your home network. Unfortunately, there are several complications:</p><ul>
<li>Most phones sold in the U.S. are <b>SIM-locked</b> (the phone will not function if a SIM card for a different network is inserted) to the carrier which sells the device.
<ul>
<li>A limited selection of unlocked phones may be found in some small electronics shops. Best Buy sells unlocked mobile phones at stores in some tourist shopping destinations (like <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> or <a href="/wiki/Orlando" title="Orlando">Orlando</a>). Online, there are only a handful of retailers selling unlocked phones.</li>
<li>Service providers have differing policies, but generally will only give out unlock codes to customers in good standing after 3–6 months of service with them. Circumventing a SIM lock without the service provider's authorization is illegal in the U.S., but not in some other countries, where the software may be modified at a mobile phone repair shop for a modest price (under $40).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phone prices are often subsidized by 2-year contracts. Advertised prices range from free (basic phones &amp; some cheap/older smartphone models) to about $100-250 for the latest smartphones. Paying out of pocket will be significantly more expensive (e.g., $450–700 for most newer smartphones), and isn't allowed for certain phones, depending on the phone and the carrier selling it.</li>
<li>U.S. mobile phone networks include many frequencies, especially for data (e.g. 3G, 4G, LTE), that aren't used elsewhere in the world. This means that U.S. phones may only be compatible with limited parts of foreign mobile phone networks.
<ul>
<li>Verizon, Sprint, and many low-cost networks use the CDMA protocol—which is only used in U.S. and some parts of Asia—while AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and a couple low-cost networks use the GSM protocol that is used worldwide.</li>
<li>Phone makers typically make several models of the same phone which are physically and visually identical but which contain different antennas that are compatible with different frequencies. For example, six models of the Samsung Galaxy S4 were sold in the U.S.; all were visually identical, but supported a different combination of frequencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most mobile phones have been branded with the carrier's apps (which often can't be uninstalled) and external stickers/decals. This varies from merely inconvenient to just a nuisance.</li>

Inside a 1950s-style diner, a quintessentially American institution</div>
</div>
</div><p>The variety of restaurants throughout the U.S. is remarkable. In a major city such as New York, it may be possible to find a restaurant from nearly every country in the world. In addition to the usual array of independent restaurants, the U.S. possesses a singularly baffling array of fast food and casual chain restaurants; even if you think you know U.S. fast food from the chains' international outlets, the sheer variety domestically is immense.</p><p>Ethnic cuisine from other parts of the world is frequently adapted to American tastes and/or made with locally available ingredients. This is particularly true of Asian cuisines, especially Chinese (see below).</p><p>Many restaurants, especially those serving fast food or breakfast, do not serve alcohol, and many others may only serve beer and wine. Portions are generally huge, regardless of restaurant style, although this trend has moderated recently with increasingly health-conscious customers. Many restaurants now offer several portion options, though it may not be immediately obvious. Ask when ordering if portion choices are available. Taking home "left overs" is very common and is a good way to get two meals for the price of one. Ask for a to-go box at the end of your meal if you have not cleared your plate.</p><p>In much of America, home-cooked food is substantially better than restaurant fare. This is particularly true in rural areas and small towns. If you have the opportunity to attend a <i>carry-in dinner</i> or <i>pot luck</i>, this is a chance not to be missed.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Smoking">Smoking</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=71" title="Edit section: Smoking">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>There is no nationwide ban on smoking, so whether you are allowed to smoke in a bar or restaurant or other public indoor space varies between, and even within, states. In most cases, it is banned. If there is a "No Smoking" sign, lighting up may get you ejected, fined, or even arrested, in addition to dirty looks.</p><p>Smoking has acquired a social stigma—even where it is permitted. You may want to ask the people around you whether they mind before lighting up. Many states have laws about smoking near public entrances, keep an eye out for posted signs stating a minimum distance to the door although enforcement is not consistent. Typically if you find an ash tray or a butt station, you are safe to smoke there.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_restaurants">Types of restaurants</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=72" title="Edit section: Types of restaurants">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>Large cities host many examples of every type of restaurant imaginable from inexpensive neighborhood eateries to extravagant <b>full-service</b> restaurants with extensive wine lists and prices to match. Most medium sized cities and suburbs will also field a decent selection. In the most "up-scale" restaurants, rules for men to wear jackets and ties, while once <i>de rigueur</i>, are becoming more relaxed. Check with the restaurant if in doubt.</p><p><b>Fast food</b> restaurants such as McDonald's, Subway and Burger King are ubiquitous, but the variety of this type of restaurant in the U.S. is astounding: burgers, hot dogs, pizza, fried chicken, barbecued meat, and ice cream only begin to touch on it. Alcoholic beverages are not served in these restaurants; "soda" (often called "pop" in the Midwest through Western New York and Western Pennsylvania, or generically "coke" in the South) or other soft drinks are standard. Don't be surprised when you order a soda, are handed a paper cup and expected to fill it yourself from the soda fountain (refills are often free). The quality of the food varies, but because of the strictly limited menu, it is generally good, especially in the daytime. Also the restaurants are usually clean and bright, and the service is limited but friendly. Tipping is not expected but you must clear your table after your meal. A few restaurants, called <b>"drive-ins"</b>, serve you directly in your car.</p><p><b>Takeout</b> food is very common in larger cities for meals that may take a little longer to prepare than in a fast-food place. Place an order by phone or online and then go to the restaurant to pick it up and take it away. Many places will also deliver; in some cities, it is easier to have pizza or Chinese food delivered than to find a sit-down restaurant. Pizza delivery is especially ubiquitous in the U.S.; towns as small as 5,000 typically have at least one establishment offering delivery, and often more than one. The main national pizza chains are Pizza Hut (mostly dine-in restaurants that also offer takeout and delivery), Domino's (no dine-in), Papa John's (also no dine-in), and Little Caesars (mostly takeout only, with some locations also offering delivery). Local pizza places often compete successfully against the big national chains, and many such restaurants also offer takeout and delivery.</p><p><b>Fast-Casual</b> restaurants offer a fast-food dining style (no waitstaff, no alcohol), but the meals tend to be fresher and healthier. The food takes a bit longer to prepare—and costs a few dollars more—than at fast food joints, but it's generally worth it. Notable examples include Chipotle (Tex-Mex), Noodles and Company, Panera Bread (soup and sandwiches), Five Guys (burgers) and Freddies Burgers.</p><p><b>Diners</b> are typically American and have remained popular since their heyday in the 1940s and 1950s. They are usually individually run, open 24-hours and found on major roads, though they also appear in large cities and suburbs. They offer a wide variety of huge meals that often include soup or salad, bread, beverage and dessert. They are usually busy for breakfast, in the morning or after the bars close. Diner chains include <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.dennys.com/">Denny's</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.normsrestaurants.com/">Norm's</a>, and (in the South) <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wafflehouse.com">Waffle House</a>.</p><p>No compendium of American restaurants would be complete without mentioning the <b><a href="/wiki/Truck_stops" title="Truck stops">truck stop</a></b>. You will only encounter these places if you are taking an intercity auto or bus trip. They are found on the interstate highways and cater to truckers. There will be diesel fuel and separate parking for the "big rigs" and showers for the drivers who sleep in their cabs. These fabled restaurants serve what passes on the road for "plain home cooking": hot roast beef sandwiches, meatloaf, fried chicken, and of course the ubiquitous burger and fries—expect large portions! The three major chains are Pilot/Flying J, TA/Petro, and Love's. These generally have 24-hour restaurants, including "all you can eat" buffets and large breakfasts, often served in skillets. You are most likely to find such a restaurant at a TA or Petro (most truck stops also have national fast food outlets). Truckers know their eating: if there are plenty of trucks outside, it'll be good.</p><p><b>Chain</b> sit-down restaurants are a step up in quality and price from diners and truck stops, although those with discerning palates will probably still be disappointed. Some specialize in a type of food (e.g. seafood) or a particular national cuisine, others have broader offerings. Some are well known only for breakfast, such as the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ihop.com/">International House of Pancakes</a> (IHOP) which serves it all day in addition to other meals. A few of the larger chains include <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.redlobster.com/">Red Lobster</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.olivegarden.com/">Olive Garden</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.applebees.com/">Applebee's</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.fridays.com/">T.G.I. Friday's</a>. These restaurants tend to serve alcohol.</p><p>The largest cities will have one or more <b>fine dining</b> establishments, the quality of which can vary from "overpriced" to "exquisite". Some will have a dress code; if jackets or ties are required, they will sometimes be made available to borrow.</p><p>Some bars double as restaurants and serve food late. Bars, including their dining areas, may be off-limits to those under 21.</p><p>Soft drinks come with a liberal supply of ice. Asking for no ice is acceptable, and the drink will still probably be fairly cool. Water is usually served chilled and with ice, unless you request otherwise. It will typically not be carbonated; if you want carbonated water, ask for "sparkling water." Bottled water, still or sparkling, will cost at least $1–2. Sit-down restaurants will often bring free iced tap water, even before taking your drink order. At fast food restaurants, bottled water is assumed unless you specify "ice water" or "tap water". Coffee, tea and soft drinks are sometimes refilled at no extra charge, but you should ask if this is not explicitly stated.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_Service">Types of Service</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=73" title="Edit section: Types of Service">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>Many restaurants aren't open for <b>breakfast</b>. Those that do (mostly fast-food and diners), serve eggs, toast, pancakes, cereals, coffee, etc. Most restaurants stop serving breakfast between 10 and 11AM, but some, especially diners, will serve breakfast all day. As an alternative to a restaurant breakfast, one can grab breakfast food such as doughnuts, muffins, fruits, coffee, and packaged drinks at almost any gas station, coffee shop, or convenience store (such as 7-Eleven, Circle K or AM/PM).</p><p><b>Continental Breakfast</b> is a term primarily used by hotels and motels to describe a cold breakfast offering of cereal, breads, muffins, fruit, etc. Milk, fruit juices, hot coffee and tea are the typical beverages. There is usually a toaster for your bread. This is a quick, cheap way of getting morning food.</p><p><b>Lunch</b> can be a good way to get food from a restaurant whose dinners are out of your price range.</p><p><b>Dinner</b>, the main meal. Depending on culture, region, and personal preference, is usually enjoyed between 5 and 9PM. Most restaurants will be willing to box up your leftover food (typically referred to as a "to go box"). Making reservations in advance is a good idea if the restaurant is popular, "up-scale", or you are dining in a large group.</p><p><b>Buffets</b> are generally a cheap way to get a large amount of food. For a single, flat, rate, you can have as many servings of whatever foods are set out. However, since food can be sitting out in the heat for hours, the quality can suffer. Generally, buffets serve American or Chinese food.</p><p>Many restaurants serve <b>Sunday brunch</b>, served morning through early afternoon, with both breakfast and lunch items. There is often a buffet. Like most other meals, quality and price can vary by restaurant.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_food">Types of food</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=74" title="Edit section: Types of food">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class="thumb tright">

A cheeseburger, or a hamburger with cheese</div>
</div>
</div><p>Typical American food items that can be found at most restaurants or large gatherings include hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, and pie. While many types of food are unchanged throughout the United States, there are a few distinct regional varieties of food. The most notable is in the <a href="/wiki/South_(United_States_of_America)" title="South (United States of America)">South</a>, where traditional local fare includes grits (ground maize porridge), collard greens (a boiled vegetable, often flavored with ham and a dash of vinegar), sweet iced tea, barbecue (not unique to this region, but best and most common here), catfish (served deep-fried with a breadcrumb coating), cornbread, okra, red beans, and gumbo (a stew of seafood or sausage, rice, okra, and sometimes tomatoes).</p><div class="thumb tright">

Rib tips in <a href="/wiki/Memphis" title="Memphis">Memphis</a></div>
</div>
</div><p><b>Barbecue</b>, <b>BBQ</b>, or <b>barbeque</b> is a delicious American specialty. At its best, it's beef brisket, ribs, or pork shoulder slowly wood smoked for hours. Ribs are served as a whole- or half-rack or cut into individual ribs, brisket is usually sliced thin, and the pork shoulder can be shredded ("pulled pork") or chopped ("chopped pork"). Sauces of varying spiciness may be served on the dish, or provided on the side. There are also unique regional styles of barbecue, with the best generally found in the <a href="/wiki/South_(United_States_of_America)" title="South (United States of America)">South</a>. The most distinct styles come from <a href="/wiki/Kansas_City" title="Kansas City">Kansas City</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tennessee" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, and <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>. <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maryland" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> have a style that focuses on beef barbecued in an outdoor pit or brick oven. However, barbecue of some variety is generally available throughout the country. Barbecued meat can be served with a variety of sides, including chili, corn on the cob, coleslaw and potato salad. Barbecue restaurants are unpretentious and the best food is often found at very casual establishments. Expect plastic dinnerware, picnic tables, and sandwiches on cheap white bread. Barbecue found on the menu at a fancy chain or non-specialty restaurant is likely to be less authentic. Ribs and chicken are almost always eaten with your fingers; tackle pork and brisket either with a fork or in a sandwich. Some Americans (though never Southerners) use "barbecue" as a synonym for "cookout": a party where the likes of chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs are grilled outdoors (rather than smoked). These can be fun, but they don't represent the American BBQ cuisine.</p><p>With a rich tradition of immigration, America has a wide variety of <b>ethnic foods</b>; everything from Ethiopian cuisine to Laotian food is available in major cities with large immigrant populations.</p><p><b>Italian food</b> is perhaps the most pervasive of ethnic cuisines in America, though this food has often taken a different direction than Italian food in Italy. All but the smallest villages have at least one restaurant that specializes in pizza, and many also have pasta restaurants as well. There are also restaurants that specialize in <b>German</b> or <b>French</b> food, but in much smaller numbers.</p><p><b>Chinese food</b> is widely available and adjusted to American tastes. Authentic Chinese food can be found in restaurants in Chinatowns in addition to communities with large Chinese populations. Japanese <b>sushi</b>, <b>Vietnamese</b>, and <b>Thai food</b> have also been adapted for the American market in recent years. <b>Fusion</b> cuisine combines Asian ingredients and techniques with more traditional American presentation. <b>Indian food</b> outlets are available in most major U.S. cities and towns.</p><p><b>Mexican/Hispanic/Tex-Mex food</b> is very popular, but again in a localized version. Combining in various ways beans, rice, cheese, and spiced beef or chicken with round flatbread loaves called <i>tortillas</i>, dishes are usually topped with spicy tomato <i>salsa</i>, sour cream, and an avocado-based dip called <i>guacamole</i>. Small authentic Mexican <i>taquerias</i> can be found easily in <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Southwest_(United_States_of_America)" title="Southwest (United States of America)">Southwest</a>, and increasingly in cities throughout the country.</p><p><b>Middle Eastern</b> and <b>Greek</b> foods are also becoming popular in the United States. The <i>gyro</i> (known as "doner kebab" or "shawarma" in Europe) is a popular Greek sandwich of sliced processed lamb on a pita bread topped with lettuce, tomatoes and a yogurt-cucumber sauce. <i>Hummus</i> (a ground chickpea dip/spread) and <i>baklava</i> pastries are frequently found in supermarkets, along with an increasingly widespread and high-quality array of "pita" products.</p><p><b>Vegetarian food</b> is easy to come by in big urban areas. As vegetarians are becoming more common in the U.S., so are the restaurants that cater to them. Most big cities and college towns will have vegetarian restaurants serving exclusively or primarily vegetarian dishes. In smaller towns you may need to check the menu at several restaurants before finding a vegetarian main course, or else make up a meal out of side dishes. Wait staff can be helpful answering questions about meat content, but be very clear about your personal definition of vegetarian, as dishes with fish, chicken, egg, or even small quantities of beef or pork flavoring may be considered vegetarian. This is especially common with vegetable side dishes in the South. Meat-free breakfast foods such as pancakes or eggs are readily available at diners.</p><p>People on low-fat or low-calorie diets should be fairly well-served in the U.S., as there has been a continuing trend in <b>calorie consciousness</b> since the 1970s. Even fast-food restaurants have "lite" specials, and can provide charts of calorie and fat counts on request.</p><p>For the <i>backpacker</i> or those on <i>very restricted budgets</i>, American <b>supermarkets</b> offer an almost infinite variety of <i>pre-packaged</i>/<i>pre-processed</i> foods that are either ready or almost ready for consumption, e.g. breakfast cereal, ramen noodles, canned soups, frozen dinner, etc.</p><p>In the largest cities, "corner stores" abound. These small convenience stores carry a variety of snacks, drinks, and prepackaged foods. Unlike most convenience stores, their products are sold at relatively low prices (especially by urban standards) and can provide for snacks or even (nutritionally partial) meals for a budget no more than $5 a day.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Etiquette">Etiquette</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=75" title="Edit section: Etiquette">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>It is usually inappropriate to join a table already occupied by other diners, even if it has unused seats; Americans prefer this degree of privacy when they eat. Exceptions are cafeteria-style eateries with long tables, at crowded informal eateries and cafés you may have success asking a stranger if you can share the table they're sitting at, and at some inexpensive Chinese restaurants where staff will direct you to share a table. Striking up a conversation in this situation may or may not be welcome, however.</p><p>Table manners, while varying greatly, are typically European-influenced. Slurping or making other noises while eating is considered rude, as is loud conversation (including phone calls). It is fairly common to wait until everybody at your table has been served before eating. You should lay cloth napkins across your lap; you can do the same with paper napkins, or keep them on the table. Offense isn't taken if you don't finish your meal, and most restaurants will package the remainder to take with you, or provide a box for you to do this yourself (sometimes euphemistically called a "doggy bag", implying that the leftovers are for your pet). If you want to do this, ask the server to get the remainder "to go"; this term will be almost universally understood, and will not cause any embarrassment. Some restaurants offer an "all-you-can-eat" buffet or other service; taking home portions from such a meal is either not allowed, or carries an additional fee.</p><p>Many fast food items (sandwiches, burgers, pizza, tacos, etc.) are designed to be eaten by hand (so-called "finger food"); a few foods are almost always eaten by hand (french fries, barbecue, chicken on the bone) even at moderately nice restaurants. If unsure, eating finger food with a fork and knife probably won't offend anyone; eating fork-and-knife food by hand might, as it's considered "uncivilized" and rude.</p><p>When invited to a meal in a private home it is considered polite for a guest to ask if they can bring anything for the meal, such a dessert, a side dish, wine or beer, or for an outdoor barbecue, something useful like ice or plastic cups or plates. The host may refuse, but it is nonetheless considered good manners to bring along a small gift for the host. A bottle of wine, box of candies or fresh cut flowers are most common. Gifts of cash, prepared ready-to-serve foods, or very personal items (e.g. toiletries) are not appropriate. If you do not know your hosts very well, it may be best to avoid alcohol in certain situations, as many Americans drink alcohol very infrequently or not at all. This teetotaling is found particularly in the Bible Belt (the South and parts of the Midwest), and the Mormon Belt (Utah and to a lesser extent Idaho, Wyoming, and Arizona): Mormons, some Fundamentalist Christians and Muslims are forbidden by their religions to drink alcohol at all.</p><p>An exception is the <b>carry-in</b> or <b>potluck</b> meal, where each guest (or group/family) must bring a food dish to share with everyone; these shared dishes make up the entire meal. Usually dishes are grouped (e.g., salads, main dishes or casseroles, side dishes, desserts); you should ask the host if they want you to bring something in particular. Ideal dishes for a potluck should be served from a large <i>pot</i>, dish, or bowl, and would be spooned or forked on to diners' plates—hence the emphasis on salads, casseroles, and spoonable side dishes. These types of meals typically offer a wide assortment of well-prepared foods and may be the very best way to experience authentic American cuisine.</p></div>

America's native spirit&nbsp;— bourbon, straight up</div>
</div>
</div><p>Drinking customs in America are as varied as the backgrounds of its many people. In the cities, you can find everything from tough local "shot and a beer" bars to upscale "martini bars"; urban bars and nightclubs will often serve only simple food, or none at all. In the suburbs, alcohol is mainly served in restaurants rather than bars. And in rural areas, the line between "bar" and "restaurant" is often blurred to the point of meaninglessness; with few establishments nearby, locals go to the same place for both meals and nightlife. A few states have <b>dry counties</b>, places where it is illegal to sell alcohol for local consumption; these are mostly in rural areas.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Laws">Laws</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=77" title="Edit section: Laws">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p><b>The drinking age is 21 throughout the U.S.</b> except in most of the outlying territories (where it is 18). Enforcement of this varies, but if you're under 30 be prepared to show photo ID. Some retailers may not accept a foreign driver's license (except from Canada) so having your passport available when purchasing alcohol is strongly advised. In some states, people who are under 21 are not even allowed to be present in a bar or liquor store.</p><p>Alcohol sales are typically prohibited after 2AM. In some states, most stores can only sell beer and wine; hard liquor is sold at dedicated liquor stores. Several "dry counties" – mostly in southern states – ban some or all types of alcohol in public establishments; private clubs (with nominal membership fees) are often set up to get around this. Sunday sales are restricted in some areas.</p><p>Most towns ban drinking in the open with varying degrees of enforcement. Even if it is allowed, a visible bottle (rather than one in a small bag) is either illegal or justifies police attention. Being "drunk and disorderly" is banned. <b>Drunk driving</b> comes under fairly harsh scrutiny. A blood-alcohol level of 0.08% is considered "under the Influence" and many states consider a level of 0.05% as "impaired". If you're under 21, most states have limits of 0.00-0.02%. Foreigners will typically be deported, even well established permanent residents. It is also usually against the law to have an open container of alcohol anywhere in a car other than in the trunk; this can be heavily fined.

"Cider" without further qualification is just an unfiltered variety of apple juice. "Hard cider" is the alcoholic drink from fermented apples; it is generally unpopular despite Americans having been its most enthusiastic consumers two centuries ago.</p><p><b>Beer</b> constitutes approximately half the alcohol consumed in the U.S. Nationally known light lagers (which are cheap and mediocre) remain most prevalent, despite the emergence of other types of beer in the 1990s. <b>Microbreweries</b>, which specialize in small-batch, high-quality beers made by traditional methods, add much-needed variety. Microbrews are often inventive and experimental; some are excellent examples of classic beer styles, while others push the limits and develop new, unique flavors. Most are individual regional brewers, although a few are reaching national distribution. Some bars and restaurants carry microbrews, while others don't, seemingly at random. <b>Brew pubs</b> combine microbrewery and bar and serve highly regarded beer that is made on the premises. <a href="/wiki/Vermont" title="Vermont">Vermont</a> offers the highest ratio of microbreweries per capita in the country followed by <a href="/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Montana" title="Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maine" title="Maine">Maine</a>, while <a href="/wiki/Washington_(state)" title="Washington (state)">Washington</a> grows 77 percent of the total United States hop crop, a key ingredient in beer making.</p><p><b>Wine</b> is available across the quality spectrum. American wines are labeled primarily by the grape variety. A rough guide to quality comes in the specificity of the labeling. Color alone ("Red", "white", and "rosé" or "pink") denotes the lowest echelon. Above this, regions are labeled by state (e.g. "California"), an area of a state (e.g. "Central Coast"), a county or other small region (e.g. "Willamette Valley"), or a specific vineyard (e.g. "Dry Creek Vineyard").</p><p>The cheapest wine tends to come in a plastic bag encased in a box. "Fortified wines", known as "bum wine", are the precise opposite of high-class European port, sherry or Madeira.</p><p>All 50 states practice some sort of winemaking, though 90% of America's wine—including its most highly regarded from the <b><a href="/wiki/Napa_Valley" title="Napa Valley">Napa Valley</a></b>—are <b>Californian</b>. Wines from Oregon's <b><a href="/wiki/Willamette_Valley" title="Willamette Valley">Willamette Valley</a></b> and <b><a href="/wiki/Washington_(state)" title="Washington (state)">Washington state</a></b> represent good value as they are less well known. <b><a href="/wiki/Michigan" title="Michigan">Michigan</a></b>, <b><a href="/wiki/Colorado%27s_Wine_Country" title="Colorado's Wine Country">Colorado's Wine Country</a></b>, and New York State's <b><a href="/wiki/Finger_Lakes" title="Finger Lakes">Finger Lakes</a></b> produce German-style whites which have won international competitions.

Wine is taken quite seriously by some restaurants, but as with all other alcoholic drinks in restaurants, expect to pay up to four times the liquor store price for a bottle.</p><p><b>Hard alcohol</b> (i.e. spirits) is usually drunk with mixers, but it is also served "on the rocks" (with ice) or "straight up" (unmixed, with no ice, also called "neat"). Whiskey, the traditional choice, remains popular despite the increased popularity of vodka and other clear spirits. <b>Whiskey</b> is distilled from many different grains. The main types are rye (made with mainly rye, a relative of wheat), malt (made with mainly barley) and bourbon (made with mainly corn, i.e. maize).</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nightlife">Nightlife</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=79" title="Edit section: Nightlife">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class="thumb tright">

Country music dance clubs, or <b>honky tonks</b>, are laid fairly thick in the South and West, especially in rural areas and away from the coasts, but one or two can be found in almost any city. Also, gay/lesbian nightclubs exist in nearly every medium- to large-sized city.</p><p><b>"Happy hour"</b>, a period usually lasting from 30 minutes to three hours, usually between 5PM and 8PM, sees significant discounts on selected drinks.

</div>
</div><p>By far the most common form of lodging in rural United States and along many Interstates is the <b>motel</b>. Providing inexpensive rooms to automotive travelers, most motels are clean and reasonable with a limited array of amenities: telephone, TV, bed, bathroom. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.motel6.com/">Motel 6</a> (+1 800 466-8356) is a national chain with reasonable rates ($30–$70, depending on the city). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.super8.com/">Super 8 Motels</a> (+1 800 800-8000) provides reasonable accommodations throughout the country as well. Reservations are typically unnecessary, which is convenient since you don't have to arbitrarily interrupt a long road trip; you can simply drive until you're tired then find a room. However, some are used by adults looking to book a night for sex or illicit activities and many are located in undesirable areas.</p><p>Business or extended-stay hotels are increasingly available across the country. They can be found in smaller towns across the Midwest or in coastal urban areas. Generally they are more expensive than motels, but not as expensive as full-scale hotels, with prices around $70 to $170. While the hotels may appear to be the size of a motel, they may offer amenities from larger hotels. Examples include Marriott's Courtyard by Marriott, Fairfield Inns, and Residence Inns; Hilton's Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn; Holiday Inn's Holiday Inn Express; Starwood's Four Points by Sheraton, and Hyatt Place.</p><p>Some extended-stay hotels are directed at business travelers or families on long-term stays (that are often relocating due to corporate decisions). These hotels often feature kitchens in most rooms, afternoon social events (generally by a pool), and serve continental breakfast. Such "suite" hotels are roughly equivalent to the <b>serviced apartments</b> seen in other countries, though the term "serviced apartments" is not generally used in American English.</p><p><b>Hotels</b> are available in most cities and usually offer more services and amenities than motels. Rooms usually run about $80–$300 per night, but very large, glamorous, and expensive hotels can be found in most major cities, offering luxury suites larger than some houses. Check-in and check-out times are almost always fall in the range of 11AM-noon and 2PM-4PM. Many U.S. cities now have "edge cities" in their suburbs which feature high-quality upscale hotels aimed at affluent business travelers. These hotels often feature all the amenities of their downtown/CBD cousins (and more), but at less exorbitant prices.</p><p>In many rural areas, especially on the coasts and in New England, <b>bed and breakfast</b> (B&amp;B) lodging can be found. Usually in converted houses or buildings with less than a dozen units, B&amp;Bs feature a more home-like lodging experience, with free breakfast served (of varying quality and complexity). Bed and breakfasts range from about $50 to $200 per night, with some places being much steeper. They can be a nice break from the impersonality of chain hotels and motels. Unlike Europe, most American bed and breakfasts are unmarked; one must make a reservation beforehand and receive directions there.</p><p>The two best-known hotel guides covering the U.S. are the AAA (formerly American Automobile Association; typically pronounced "Triple-A") TourBooks, available to members and affiliated auto clubs worldwide at local AAA offices; and the Mobil Travel Guide, available at bookstores. There are several websites booking hotels online; be aware that many of these sites add a small commission to the room rate, so it may be cheaper to book directly through the hotel. On the other hand, some hotels charge more for "drop-in" business than reserved rooms or rooms acquired through agents and brokers, so it's worth checking both.</p><p>There are also <b><a href="/wiki/Hostels" title="Hostels">youth hostels</a></b> across the U.S. Most are affiliated with the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.hiayh.org/">American Youth Hostel</a> organization (a Hostelling International member). Quality of hostels varies widely, but at $8–$24 per night, the prices are unbeatable. Despite the name, AYH membership is open to people of any age. Non-AYH hostels are also available, particularly in larger cities. Be aware that hostels are clustered in more touristy locations, do not assume that all mid sized towns will have a hostel.</p><p><b>Camping</b> can also be a very affordable lodging option, especially with good weather. The downside of camping is that most campgrounds are outside urban regions, so it's not much of an option for trips to big cities. There is a huge network of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nps.gov/">National Parks</a> (+1 800 365-2267), with most states and many counties having their own park systems, too. Most state and national campgrounds are of excellent quality, with beautiful natural environments. Expect to pay $7–$20 per car on entry. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.koakampgrounds.com/">Kampgrounds of America</a> (KOA) has a chain of commercial campground franchises across the country, of significantly less charm than their public-sector equivalents, but with hookups for recreational vehicles and amenities such as laundromats. Countless independently owned private campgrounds vary in character.</p><p>Some <b>unusual</b> lodging options are available in specific areas or by prior arrangement. For example, you might enjoy staying on a <b>houseboat</b> in <a href="/wiki/Lake_Tahoe" title="Lake Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a> or the Erie Canal. Or stay in a <b>treehouse</b> in Oregon. More conventional lodging can be found at college or university dormitories, a few of which rent out rooms to travelers during the summertime. Finally, in many tourist areas, as well as big cities, one can rent a furnished house by the day.</p></div>

<a href="/wiki/Studying_abroad#United_States" title="Studying abroad">Studying full-time in the United States</a> is an excellent opportunity for young adults seeking an advanced education, a chance to see a foreign country, and a better understanding of the U.S. and its people. It can be done independently by applying directly to a college for admission, or through the "study abroad" or "foreign exchange" department of a college in your own country, usually for a single term or one year. (Either approach requires, at minimum, an F or J student visa.) The latter is usually easiest; the two institutions will handle much of the arrangements, and you don't have to make a commitment to four years living in a strange country. Be forewarned, however: many state universities and private colleges are located in small towns, hundreds of miles from any big urban centers. Don't expect to spend your weekends in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a> if your college is in <a href="/wiki/North_Dakota" title="North Dakota">North Dakota</a>. The U.S. attracts more international students than any other country in the world and a lot of cultural diversity can be seen throughout its top universities.</p><p>Note that unless you have applied for and received special permission in advance, international students are <i>not</i> allowed to work off-campus in the United States.</p><p>Any courses that contribute credits towards the awarding an academic degree will require you to obtain a student visa in advance regardless of how short your stay in the US may be. However, short courses that do not count as academic credits may be undertaken on a tourist visa, or under the visa-waiver program. In large cities, open universities may offer short non-credit courses on all sorts of practical topics, from ballroom dance to buying real estate. They are a good place to learn a new skill and meet people.</p></div>

Young people who are full-time students of certain nationalities can apply for a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1267.html">J1 "Exchange Visitor" visa</a> which permits paid work as a nanny or summer work for up to 4 months in virtually any type of job. The United States Department of State has full information on applying for this type of visa including the precise categories that qualify. Once you have received work authorization, you will have to apply for a <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security Number (SSN)</a></b> for your employer to report your wages to the government for tax purposes. You can start working before you receive your number in the mail, but you must provide your employer with a receipt from the Social Security Administration indicating that you have applied for one.</p><p>The H-1B visa allows a limited number of skilled and certain unskilled employees to temporarily work in the United States. It usually requires a tertiary degree and is based on a petition filed by an American employer. The job you wish to apply for should be related to your degree. The most common careers of hard-to-get H-1B visa holders are nurses, mathematics teachers, and computer science professionals. On the other hand, there is the more permanent employment-based immigrant visa which has similar requirements to the H-1B visa. Before an employer can arrange any work visa, he must ensure that nobody within his locale is willing or qualified to do the job before considering you.</p><p>Unless you are a permanent resident of the United States (i.e. green card holder), as a foreigner, you will need a work visa to be allowed to work in the United States. Paid work is not allowed on a B1/B2 visitor visa or the visa-waiver program, though volunteer work is allowed. Working unlawfully in the United States runs the very real risk of arrest, deportation, and ineligibility to re-enter the country. Illegal immigrants also run the risk of dangerous work conditions. Foreigners on F1 student visas are allowed to work for up to 20 hours a week on-campus in their respective institutions, but are generally banned from working off-campus unless they have applied for and received special permission in advance. Note that the above restrictions apply to <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canadians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" title="Bermuda">Bermudians</a> as well. The only exceptions to this rule are citizens of <a href="/wiki/Palau" title="Palau">Palau</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Islands" title="Marshall Islands">Marshall Islands</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Federated_States_of_Micronesia" title="Federated States of Micronesia">Federated States of Micronesia</a>, who are allowed to live and work in the United States indefinitely with only a valid passport.

Unfortunately, con artists both in the U.S. and overseas often prey on people's desire to travel or work in the U.S. Keep in mind that visa applications do not usually require an attorney or other intermediary, so you should be wary of and verify any "advice" offered by third parties, especially non-lawyers. If in doubt about properly applying for such visas then it is recommended to use a licensed immigration attorney.</p><p>Keep in mind that anyone entering under the Visa Waiver Program is <b>not</b> permitted to adjust their status for any reason.

However, few visitors experience any problems; common-sense precautions and staying alert are sufficient to avoid trouble. Crime is usually connected with gangs and drugs in the inner cities, and with heated disputes. Avoid those and you'll be fine. Urban tourist areas are heavily policed and are safe from all but petty crimes.</p><p>Urban areas tend to have homeless people who may aggressively ask for money. If you feel harassed, say "No" firmly and walk away.</p><p>Illegal immigration and drug smuggling, and the authorities' heavy-handed treatment of them, make the Mexican border undesirable to visit. Official border crossings are safe to use.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Police">Police</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=85" title="Edit section: Police">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>American police are generally polite, professional, and honest. When in uniform, they are also more formal, cautious, and cold than police in, say, Latin America—especially in large cities. If stopped by traffic police, you should stay calm, be polite and cooperative, avoid making sudden movements, and state what you are doing if you need to reach for your purse or wallet to present your identification. Turn on the inside car lights and keep your hands on the wheel to make it clear that you are not a threat; do not exit the vehicle unless told to do so.</p><p><b>Do <i>not</i> offer bribes</b> to a police officer in any way or under any circumstances. U.S. police culture categorically rejects bribes, and the mere suggestion would very likely result in your immediate arrest. If you need to pay a fine, don't try to pay the officer; he or she can direct you to the appropriate police station, courthouse, or government office. Most minor traffic infractions can be paid by mail. Increasingly fines can be paid online or over the phone within a matter of minutes of receiving the ticket, though often for a convenience fee of a few dollars. Instructions are often printed on the ticket.</p><p>There are three types of police you are most likely to encounter: state police/highway patrol units on state highways, deputy sheriffs employed by county governments in rural areas, and police officers employed by city or town governments in urban areas. Some transit agencies in major cities have their own transit police departments separate from city or county law enforcement. Federal law enforcement officers are generally found only in or near federal facilities, such as ports of entry. If you encounter them elsewhere, it is usually because they are investigating specific allegations of federal crimes.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Emergency_services">Emergency services</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=86" title="Edit section: Emergency services">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>Dialing <b>9-1-1</b> at any telephone will reach the emergency services (police, fire, ambulance, etc.). Any U.S. phone, regardless if it is "active" or not, must be able to dial 911 if it is connected to the network, and such calls are always free. Unless you are calling from a mobile or Internet-based phone, the operator should be able to locate you from the phone you are using even if you do not say anything. Modern cell phones will send a GPS fix of your location down to a few meters within a few seconds of dialing 911. Dialing 911 and leaving an open line will bring all 3 emergency services to your location in under 5 minutes in most populated areas. Response time may be longer in sparsely populated areas or along the Interstates.</p><p>On any GSM mobile phone (the standard technology in most of the world, especially in Europe), you can also dial <b>112</b>, which is the standard emergency number for GSM networks worldwide. U.S. GSM carriers (AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and smaller regional operators) automatically redirect 112 calls to 911.</p><p>As in most countries, misuse of the emergency services number will result in, at the least, a call back from authorities; at most, arrest. If you reach 9-1-1 accidentally (for instance, if a misdial of the 011- international prefix gets a "9-1-1, what's your emergency?" response) stay on the line for long enough to explain to the dispatcher that you have reached a wrong number.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Border_Patrol">Border Patrol</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=87" title="Edit section: Border Patrol">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>The United States Border Patrol works near both the Canadian and the Mexican borders, as well as in Southern coastal areas like the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Keys" title="Florida Keys">Florida Keys</a>. They can verify immigration status and enforce immigration laws in the "border zones"—generally within 40 miles of Canada and 75 miles of Mexico (although the law allows for 100 miles from any border, including sea and the Great Lakes). Near Canada they tend to be unobtrusive and generally focus their work on long-distance buses and trains. In the South, systematic vehicle checkpoints or being stopped on the street with a friendly "Papers, please..." is much more likely. They tend not to target tourists specifically.</p><p>Foreigners are always required to carry their passports, visas, and landing cards (or Green Cards). Being found without them near the border could lead you to being detained until your status is verified, or possibly fined. If your documents are in order, you generally won't be questioned. In most states (<a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> is a notable exception), police and other local authorities are not allowed to question you about your immigration status or to ask to see your passport or visa unless you're arrested and charged with a crime, and then only for the purpose of connecting you with your embassy.

It has a very distinctive electronic screeching followed by a sound similar to a dial tone prior to any message. It will override AM/FM radio broadcasts as well as TV systems. Smartphones sold since about 2011 will often receive the alert as well in the form of a message based on the current location of the phone (depending on the phone's settings, this may include a loud alert tone).

Many states and cities (even those considered to be more conservative or that do not recognize same-sex marriage) have anti-discrimination codes protecting sexual orientation, including public accommodations in hotels, restaurants and transport.</p><p>The major legal controversy concerns whether same-sex <i>marriage</i> should be recognized or not. Marriage laws vary from state to state; currently 15 states and the District of Columbia allow and recognize same-sex marriages, while a handful others provide some benefits without calling them "marriages". In these states, foreign marriages will likely be recognized. The federal government, due to a 2013 court case, now also recognizes same-sex marriages including foreign marriages.</p><p>In general, the US is a safe destination for gay and lesbian travellers, though as a whole, homosexuality is somewhat not as well accepted as in Australia, Canada or Western Europe. Most Americans take a live-and-let-live approach to sexuality, but there are significant exceptions. It's generally not a problem to be open about your sexual orientation, though you may receive unwanted attention or remarks in some situations. Attitudes toward homosexuality vary widely even in regions with a reputation for tolerance or intolerance. Acceptance is most common in major cities throughout the country and smaller cities, suburbs and college towns especially around the Pacific Coast, the Northeast and Hawaii, with acceptance in these areas generally being on par with Western Europe. Homophobia and anti-gay violence may be encountered anywhere, especially in some suburban and rural areas of the Southeast and interior West, but the chances of this happening to you are low.</p><p>Gay-friendly destinations, where openly gay couples are common, include <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Manhattan/Chelsea" title="Manhattan/Chelsea">Chelsea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rochester_(New_York)" title="Rochester (New York)">Rochester</a> in Western <a href="/wiki/New_York_State" title="New York State" class="mw-redirect">New York State</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Chicago/Lakeview-North_Center" title="Chicago/Lakeview-North Center">Boystown</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Seattle/Capitol_Hill-Central_District" title="Seattle/Capitol Hill-Central District">Capitol Hill</a>, <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>'s <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco/Castro-Noe_Valley" title="San Francisco/Castro-Noe Valley">Castro Street</a>, <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Washington_(D.C.)/Dupont_Circle" title="Washington (D.C.)/Dupont Circle" class="mw-redirect">Dupont Circle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Miami_Beach" title="Miami Beach">Miami Beach</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Miami/South_Beach" title="Miami/South Beach" class="mw-redirect">South Beach</a>, <a href="/wiki/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Atlanta/Midtown" title="Atlanta/Midtown">Midtown</a> and <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>' <a href="/wiki/West_Hollywood" title="West Hollywood">West Hollywood</a>.

In other smaller cities, there are neighborhoods where gay people tend to congregate, many have resource centers for LGBT people.</p><p>Some businesses specifically advertise that they are LGBT-friendly by displaying symbols (typically a rainbow flag) on their storefront.</p><p>Men planning to engage in any sexual activity should be aware of the heightened risk of HIV and other infections in the United States. A gay American man is 44 times more likely to contract HIV than a heterosexual one, and 46 times more likely to contract syphilis. This risk grows greatly among men likely to engage in one-night stands and other higher-risk behavior. In a nation where 0.5% of the population are infected with HIV, unprotected sex is a very real risk. Precautions, including safer sex, are strongly advised during your stay. Most cities have affordable or free testing and treatment centers for STIs, though hours may be limited and waits may be long. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> clinics are often an affordable alternative. The lifelong repercussions of HIV or other STIs aren't covered by many insurance policies. Seeking health care elsewhere can be very pricey, as the U.S. medical system is private and largely operates on a for-profit basis.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Drugs">Drugs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=90" title="Edit section: Drugs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>In general U.S. drug laws can be pretty severe: even possession or transportation of small amounts can lead to prison or deportation and should be avoided by travelers. However, laws and attitudes concerning the most commonly available drug, <b>marijuana</b>, vary wildly from state to state. States like Louisiana and Florida impose large fines and lengthy prison sentences, while in other states marijuana use has been largely decriminalized. 18 states currently allow medical use of marijuana, where persons can obtain marijuana for medicinal use with a doctor's prescription and a "medical marijuana card". In some states, particularly cities on the West Coast, medical marijuana dispensaries are so commonplace that they seem almost ordinary. <a href="/wiki/Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> and <a href="/wiki/Washington_(state)" title="Washington (state)">Washington state</a> allow limited recreational use of marijuana.

Possession of firearms is regulated by individual states, and while these regulations (obtaining necessary permits, the kinds of arms permitted) vary greatly from state to state and, sometimes, from city to city within the same state, the US is generally considered to be a place with lenient attitudes towards firearm ownership, especially compared to Europe and Asia.</p><p>Non-immigrant aliens present in America for fewer than 180 days cannot possess a firearm or ammunition, unless they traveled specifically for hunting or sporting shooting, <i>or</i> they have a valid hunting license from the state they are shooting in. Entry in a recognized shooting competition also qualifies. Anything else is strictly illegal.</p><p>Your chances of getting shot are <b>very low</b>, but bear in mind that:</p><ul>
<li>In a city, a civilian with an openly visible firearm is much more of a concern than one in the country. However, many states permit "open carry", and while uncommon in cities, you may encounter somebody with a holstered firearm. Many states also have "concealed carry", laws which permit the possession of a concealed firearm in clothing or in a vehicle. Keep in mind that people with permits to carry a firearm, openly or concealed, are usually not criminals and not going to harm you.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Hunting is popular in rural America. Use of marked trails should not be a risk, but if venturing off the beaten path try to inquire if and where any hunting may currently be afoot. If there is, wear bright colors (particularly "Blaze Orange") to be highly visible to the hunters. This includes putting a bright vest on any dogs you take too. If you wish to hunt, obtain the correct permits and review the local regulations.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Target shooting is a popular sport. Many ranges welcome tourists and will have a variety of firearms available to rent and shoot at the range. Many implement a "two person minimum" rule and consider it unsafe to rent firearms to lone individuals.</li>

Rabies is more prevalent in eastern regions of the country and may be contracted from animal bites; if you are bitten by any mammal see a doctor quickly – do not wait for symptoms. Lyme disease is spread via the deer tick, which are prevalent in the woodlands and open fields of many rural areas. When venturing into the outdoors, it is a good idea to apply an insect repellent onto exposed skin surfaces that is effective against deer ticks.</p><p>Other diseases that are endemic within the United States, but are of far less concern, include <b>Hantaviral Pulmonary Syndrome</b> (found in western regions), <b>Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever</b> (mostly in the Rocky Mountain region), <b>West Nile Virus</b> (all regions) and <b>Eastern/Western Equine Encephalitis</b> (particularly in the mid-west region).</p><p>These diseases are extraordinarily rare and the medical system of the United States is very much capable of handling any of these when necessary.</p><p>For the latest in traveler's health information pertaining to the United States, including advisories and recommendations, visit the <b>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</b> destination <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/unitedstates.aspx">United States website</a></p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_care">Health care</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=95" title="Edit section: Health care">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>American health care is generally first-class but can be very expensive. Most Americans have private health insurance. The largest state-run health program, Medicare, is mainly for the elderly. Medicaid is a largely similar program for the poor. Travelers should ensure their <a href="/wiki/Travel_insurance" title="Travel insurance">travel insurance</a> is valid for the U.S. Given the high costs, some "world-wide" insurance specifically does not cover the US. Long-term visitors to the US (e.g. Work or Student visa holders) are generally required to take up private health insurance as part of their visa conditions.</p><p>To the patient, America's public (20%), private profit-making (20%), and private non-profit-making (60%) hospitals are generally indistinguishable. Inner city public hospitals may be more crowded and less well maintained, but as a whole both costs and service levels are consistently high in all types. <b>No hospital can refuse a life-threatening emergency case.</b> Private hospitals may only stabilize such patients before sending them to a nearby public hospital, which will generally act as the regional center for 24 hr emergency treatment.</p><p>In a life-threatening emergency, call <b>911</b> to summon an ambulance to take you to the nearest <b>hospital emergency room</b> ("<b>ER</b>"), or in less urgent situations get to the hospital yourself and register at the ER's front desk. Ambulance fees typically range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, and though they will never refuse to transport you in an emergency, the ambulance fees will be billed to you at a later date. Emergency rooms treat patients regardless of their ability to pay, even though their services are <b>not free</b>. Expect to pay at least $500 for a visit, plus the cost of any specific services or medications you are given. <i><b>Avoid</b></i> using ERs for non-emergency walk-in care; they are 3–4 times more expensive than other options and your non-urgent condition means you will have a wait of hours or maybe days. Most urban areas also have minor emergency centers (also called "urgent care", etc.) for situations where a full emergency room is not necessary (e.g. superficial lacerations). Their hours may be limited; few are open at night.</p><p>Walk-in <b>clinics</b> can provide routine medical care; to find one, check the yellow pages (see <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America#By_phone" title="United States of America">By phone</a> below) under "Clinics", or call a major hospital and ask. Patients see a doctor or nurse practitioner without an appointment (but often with a bit of a wait). They are typically very up-front about fees, and always accept credit cards. Make sure the clerk knows you will be paying "out of pocket"; if they assume an insurance company is paying, they may inflate the bill with unnecessary extras.</p><p><b>Dentists</b> are common across the country. They are accustomed to explaining fees over the phone, and most will accept credit cards.</p><p>Government-supported clinics offering free or low-cost testing and treatment for <b>sexually transmitted diseases</b> are widespread. Local Health Departments will provide more details. Many county clinics offer primary health care services as well, however these services are geared towards low-income residents and not foreign travelers. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> (1-800-230-7526) is a private agency with clinics and centers around the country providing birth control and other reproductive health services for both females and males.</p></div>

Sneakers (athletic shoes) are common; flip-flops and sandals are also popular in warm weather. In the winter seasons in northern states boots are commonly worn.</p><p>At the workplace, business casual (slacks, understated collared shirts without a tie, and non-athletic shoes) is now the default at many companies; more traditional industries (e.g. finance, legal, and insurance) still require suits and ties, while others (e.g. computer software) are even more casual, allowing jeans and even shorts.</p><p>When dressing up for nice restaurants or upscale entertainment, a pair of nice slacks, a collared shirt, and dress shoes will work almost everywhere.

(A few exceptions, known as "tabloids" after their most common printing format, exist; you can identify them by their exaggerated, sensational headlines.)</p><p>The national paper of record is actually <i><b>The New York Times</b></i> ($2.50 daily, $6 Sunday); although ostensibly a newspaper local to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, its coverage of national and international issues makes it daily reading just about anywhere in the country. For financial news, <i><b>The Wall Street Journal</b></i> (also based in NYC, $2) is similarly well-respected and widely read. For a more casual but still informative format, <i><b>USA Today</b></i> ($2) publishes five days a week; it's the most widely circulated print newspaper in the country. Many hotels offer free copies of either the local paper or <i>USA Today</i>; ask at the front desk. Other widely read papers include the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> (noted for its West Coast coverage) and <i>The Washington Post</i> (with exemplary political reporting from the nation's capital).</p><p>Major metropolitan areas also have a full suite of broadcast television stations; small cities might have only two or three local stations, especially if they're within broadcast range of a larger city. The major broadcast networks are ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, and PBS (taxpayer-funded public broadcasting). You'll rarely be traveling anywhere that you'd need to use an antenna, though; almost the entire country is wired for cable TV. That opens up a whole range of options for viewing, from <b>CNN</b> for news to <b>The Weather Channel</b> to <b>ESPN</b> for sports, along with countless entertainment channels.

This is also true of local seven-digit numbers starting with 976 (or, in some localities, 970).</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="International_calls">International calls</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=104" title="Edit section: International calls">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>To dial abroad, the <b>international access code is 011</b> ("+" will also work on a mobile phone).</p><p>Canada, U.S. territories, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean nations are part of the <b>North American Numbering Plan</b>, and have the same country code ("1") as the U.S. Calls made between these countries are dialed using only the full 11-digit number, but almost all are charged at international rates. Calls between the U.S. and its territories may be more expensive than calls within the contiguous 48 states and D.C., or even calls between the U.S. mainland and Canada (which typically are charged at a higher rate than domestic calls, but lower than other international calls). Alaska and Hawaii may carry a surcharge even for domestic calls, depending on the carrier and rate plan.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Phones_and_directories">Phones and directories</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=105" title="Edit section: Phones and directories">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>The once ubiquitous <b>pay phone</b> is now much harder to find. Likely locations include in or near stores and restaurants, shopping mall entrances and near bus stops. In large cities, they can be hard to find outside of transport stations and hotels. Most are coin operated (quarters, dimes and nickels) and do not accept paper bills. Prices are normally $0.50 for the first three minutes, and $0.25 for each additional minute. An online directory of pay phones can be found at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.payphone-directory.org/">Pay Phone Directory</a>.</p><p>Telephone directories contain two listings (often split into two books): the <b>white pages</b> lists number alphabetically, and the <b>yellow pages</b> list businesses by category (e.g. "Taxicabs"). Many residential land-line phones and all mobile phones are unlisted. <b>Directory assistance</b> can also be had (at an extra cost) by dialing <b>4-1-1</b> (for local numbers) or <b>1-area&nbsp;code-555-1212</b> (for other areas). If 4-1-1 doesn't work, try 555-1212, areacode-555-1212 or 1-areacode-555-1212. <b>Free directory information</b> (with advertisements) is available: dial 1-800-FREE-411 (1-800-3733-411) or browse <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://free411.com">free411.com</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://411.info">411.info</a>. Regional telephone companies' web sites (most often AT&amp;T, Verizon, or CenturyLink; also Frontier in West Virginia and FairPoint in northern New England) also provide directory information. Using the website of the company that operates in the region you are interested in yields the best results (e.g. AT&amp;T for most of California, and Verizon for the Northeast)</p><p>Long-distance telephone <b>calling cards</b> are available at most convenience stores. They are generally aimed at specific types of call (e.g. domestic, or to particular countries). Credit can be often replenished over the phone using a credit or debit card, but foreign bank cards may be refused. Card calls from payphones via toll-free numbers printed on the cards may be more expensive. There may also be effective charges per connection as well as per minute; some cards also carry hidden weekly or monthly charges which deplete their value.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mobile_phones">Mobile phones</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=106" title="Edit section: Mobile phones">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>The four largest mobile phone networks in the U.S. are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.att.com/shop/wireless">AT&amp;T</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/">Verizon Wireless</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a>. These all have good coverage of practically all urban/suburban and many rural areas of the country, although each network has strong and weak areas. Smaller networks tend to have poor coverage outside of large metropolitan areas.</p><p>There is no surcharge for calling to a mobile phone (calls to mobile phones are charged the same as calls to non-local land lines), and mobile phones don't pay surcharges when calling domestic long-distance. Instead, <b>mobile phones themselves are charged for all usage, outgoing and incoming</b>. In other words, a call to/from a mobile phone carries the same cost <i>to that mobile phone</i>, but it doesn't matter whether it's local, domestic long-distance, or toll-free. Credit packages from $25/month allow you to make hundreds of minutes' worth of calls. A failed call (or a "missed call") will be charged since you are billed from the moment you dial.</p><p>If you want to have a mobile phone in the U.S. while you travel, you have several options:</p><ul>
<li><b>Using your phone from home</b> isn't as easy as in some other countries, because the U.S. (as well as Canada and many Latin American countries) uses the 850 and 1900&nbsp;MHz frequencies, instead of 900 and 1800&nbsp;MHz used elsewhere. If you have a phone that's <b>tri- or quad-band</b> (which includes many modern phones), you should be fine; otherwise, this option won't work for you. You will also need to pay attention to whether your phone is GSM/UMTS (used by AT&amp;T and T-Mobile; common in Europe) or CDMA (used by Verizon and Sprint).
<ul>
<li><b>Roaming service</b> (using your home phone number by simply calling through a U.S. network) is expensive, and will depend on the networks your home provider has contracts with, as well as your own provider's fees. <b>Internet data plans</b> are ubiquitous in the U.S., but the normally-high prices become exorbitant once roaming fees are added.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Note that for travelers from Canada or those coming by way of Canada, Wind Mobile is relatively inexpensive for roaming; their $39 plan (roughly $45 prepaid after taxes) covers unlimited talk, international text, and 5GB of data in the US with no speed restrictions. This plan covers roaming on both T-Mobile and AT&amp;T and is something to consider for those who need the data (it costs less than similar plans offered by either US carrier and offers more data- 4GB more than T-Mobile's $50 prepaid plan and 3GB more than AT&amp;T's $60 prepaid plan). you will have a Canadian number, however, which may be a deterrent to others calling you. Unlike in its native Canada, its roaming partners support frequency bands more commonly found in international-market phones, only requiring that your phone have UMTS1900/850 and/or GSM1900/850.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Buying a SIM card</b> is a better way to use your personal phone; by installing the SIM card in your phone, you'll have a local U.S. telephone number prepaid with no contract, hundreds of minutes' worth of calls, and large amounts of data. The prices make it more economical for extended stays, but the convenience of cheap calls and data make this an attractive option for any visitor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>SIM cards are available for purchase at some electronics and convenience stores. You'll need to make sure that your phone is not SIM-locked and is compatible with the SIM card and the frequencies of the network. Read the terms carefully, as some plans are actually recurring monthly contracts rather than one-time prepaid plans.</dd>
<dd>Providers who sell prepaid SIM cards include <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.straighttalkbyop.com/">Straight Talk's Bring Your Own Phone</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/phone-sim-card">T-Mobile</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl><ul>
<li><b>Purchasing prepaid minutes and a basic mobile phone</b> is your next best option. These can be found at some grocery stores, at most electronics, office supply, and convenience stores, and of course online. A basic phone (without Internet access) and 60–100 minutes of time can be purchased for under $50. In addition to minutes, some prepaid services charge a flat fee per month (e.g. $20/month), or a fee for days when the phone is actually used (e.g. $1.25/day). Prepaid, contract-free mobile phone service is available from many prepaid-only providers, such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.boostmobile.com/">Boost Mobile</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mycricket.com/">Cricket</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.straighttalk.com/">Straight Talk</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tracfone.com/">TracFone</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.virginmobileusa.com/">Virgin Mobile USA</a>, as well as limited offerings from the major carriers: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/gophone.html">AT&amp;T's GoPhone</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/wcms/consumer/shop/prepaid.html">Verizon Prepaid Wireless</a>.</li>
<li><b>Renting a phone</b> costs from around $3/day, and can be done at shops in most of the larger airports. Depending on how long you're staying and how much you plan on calling or using data, it may be cheaper or easier to use a prepaid SIM card or prepaid phone instead.</li>
<li><b>Getting a phone contract</b>, which is what most Americans do, is something only visitors planning to stay long-term should consider. Unless you've lived in the U.S. for several months, international visitors won't have a credit rating that is recognized by U.S. service providers and therefore aren't able to subscribe to these plans. Contracts typically require a 24-month commitment (cancellation fees can reach $300!) to a specific monthly rate plan, and in exchange they subsidize the cost of the phone (so basic phones are "free", and smartphones only "cost" $50–$200).</li>

</div><p>Addressing mail with a properly-formatted address will expedite its journey with the <b>U.S. Postal Service</b> (USPS). (Not to be confused with the abbreviation for private shipper UPS.) Most important is the <b>ZIP code</b> (postal code); you can <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usps.com/zip4/">look up ZIP codes and correct address formats</a> online. ZIP codes were originally 5 digits; later they gained a hyphen and 4 extra digits, which are recommended but still optional, and used more commonly by businesses than by individuals.</p><p>Addresses should be written in three (sometimes four) lines like this:</p><blockquote>
<p>Name of recipient<br>
House number and street name<br>
City or town, two-letter state abbreviation, ZIP code</p>
</blockquote><p>or, as an example:</p><blockquote>
<p>Barack Obama<br>
1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW<br>
Washington, DC 20500-0001</p>
</blockquote><p>There are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usps.com/send/official-abbreviations.htm">recommended abbreviations for state names and terms</a> (e.g. street = ST, avenue = AVE); the USPS <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usps.com/zip4/">address and ZIP code search</a> uses them automatically. The USPS also recommends that addresses be written using only upper case letters and no punctuation (except the hyphen in the ZIP code and hyphens and slashes in some house numbers), but automated sorting machines accept mixed-case lettering and even cursive writing just as easily.</p><p>First-class international airmail postcards and letters (up to one ounce/28.5 grams) cost $1.15. (The lower rate to Canada and Mexico has ended.) All locations with a ZIP code are considered domestic, including the 50 states, U.S. possessions, <a href="/wiki/Federated_States_of_Micronesia" title="Federated States of Micronesia">Micronesia (FSM)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Islands" title="Marshall Islands">Marshall Islands</a>, and overseas military bases and ships (APO/FPO). Domestic postcards cost $0.34, and ordinary letters up to an ounce, $0.49. "Forever" stamps are available for the first ounce of both domestic and international postage, and protect against future increases. Mailing thick or rigid objects, or non-standard shapes increases the postage cost.</p><p><b>Poste Restante</b>, the receiving of mail at a post office rather than a private address, is called "General Delivery." There is no charge for this service. You will need to show ID such as a passport to pick up your mail. You do not need to have mail addressed to a particular post office by its name--use only "GENERAL DELIVERY" in the second line. For example:</p><blockquote>
<p>John Doe<br>
General Delivery<br>
Seattle, WA 98101-9999<br>
U.S.A.</p>
</blockquote><p>The last four digits of the ZIP code for General Delivery are always "9999". If the city is large enough to have multiple post offices, <b>only one</b> (usually in the center of downtown) will allow General Delivery. For example, if you're staying in the Green Lake district of Seattle (a few miles north of downtown), you <i>cannot</i> receive your mail at the Green Lake Post Office, and must travel downtown to get it. However, if you're in an independent suburb just outside a large city having only one government post office you can have it sent there.</p><p>FedEx and UPS also have a "Hold for Pickup" option and have locations throughout larger cities in the U.S. Though usually more expensive, these may be a better option when receiving something important from abroad.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_Internet">By Internet</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=108" title="Edit section: By Internet">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><p>Given the ubiquity of private Internet access, Internet cafés are <i>rare</i> outside major cities and tourist areas. However, you do have some options, except perhaps in the most rural of areas. Accessible WiFi networks, however, are common.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Wireless">Wireless</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=109" title="Edit section: Wireless">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p>The most generally useful WiFi spots are in <b>coffee shops, fast-food chains, and bookshops</b>, though you may need to buy something first. Some cities also provide free WiFi across their downtown areas. Try to use only public networks. Using a private network (even one without a password), unless authorized to do so, is illegal (though enforcement is nearly non-existent), and it may also allow criminals to track your browsing and so defraud you. Even traffic on public networks may be logged.</p><p>A few less obvious WiFi spots may be found in:</p><ul>
<li><b>Public libraries</b> – Free Wi-Fi is almost always available, although you may need to get a log-in from the information desk. The network may even be accessible 24/7, so even if the library is closed you may be able to sit outside and surf.</li>
<li><b>Starbucks</b> — <i>all</i> locations of the Starbucks coffee chain offer free Wi-Fi, as well as electrical outlets for your laptop.</li>
<li><b>Hotels</b> – chain hotels will almost always have it in the rooms and the communal areas. Smaller independent hotels are less likely to. Generally a pricey option.</li>
<li><b>Colleges and universities</b> – may have networks in their libraries and student centers that are open to non-students. Ask around.</li>
<li><b>Airports</b> – even smaller regional ones offer Wi-Fi. It may cost though.</li>
<li><b>Paid WiFi chains</b> – give you access to numerous hotspots for a small charge, e.g. Boingo.</li>
</ul><p><b>Mobile broadband</b> via a USB modem is also an option. Service providers include Verizon Wireless and Virgin Mobile (which uses the Sprint network). Make sure to check a coverage map before you buy, each company has large areas with bad or no coverage. Also, these plans are subject to data limits which are easy to exceed unknowingly! Avoid watching videos over a mobile network.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_PC_terminals">Public PC terminals</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&amp;action=edit&amp;section=110" title="Edit section: Public PC terminals">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4><p><b>Internet cafés</b> can still be found in some larger cities (e.g. New York and Los Angeles). Airports and shopping malls offer Internet access terminals for very quick use, although these are generally disappearing. Access typically costs $1 for 1–2 minutes of web time. Any public computer will likely block access to undesirable websites and log your Internet use.</p><p>You may also consider:</p><ul>
<li><b>Public libraries</b> — have PCs with broadband for public use. You will need to register with the library to get log in information, and may (rarely) need to pay a small fee.</li>
<li><b>Photocopy shops</b> — will have computers available for public use (at a cost). E.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.fedex.com/us/office/indexnew.html">FedEx Office</a> (+1 800 463 3339/+1 800 GOFEDEX; when prompted by the voice menu, say "FedEx Office" or press "64") is open 24&nbsp;hr and is nationwide. Some are also commercial mail receiving agents (such as The UPS Store) and offer fax service.</li>
<li><b>Smart hotels</b> — have "business centers" replete with computers, printers, photocopies, and fax machines that you can use at a cost.</li>
<li><b>Electronics stores</b> — the computers on display are often connected to the Internet. A quick email will be tolerated with a smile, six hours of Warcraft won't. The Apple Store is particularly generous and will allow browsing without intent to buy; however, some websites, such as Facebook, are blocked.</li>
<li><b>University libraries</b> — while private universities may restrict entry to their students and faculty, public university libraries are generally required by law to be open to the public (at least as far as books go) and they may also have a computer or two for public use.</li>
